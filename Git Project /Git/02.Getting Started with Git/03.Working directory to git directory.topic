<sn><md>### **Working directory to Git directory**
---

In Git, every file change goes through **three core areas**, often referred to as **containers** in the lifecycle of version control:

1. **Working Directory**
2. **Staging Area** (also called: Index / Intermediate Stage)
3. **Repository (Git Directory / Committed Area)**

Understanding these three containers is crucial for mastering Git operations. Let’s explore them in depth.

---

## 🗂️ 1. **Working Directory (Workspace)**

### 📌 What It Is:

* The **Working Directory** is the actual **folder on your system** where you create, edit, delete, and manage files.
* It reflects the **latest checked-out version** of your project from Git.

### 🛠️ Activities:

* You add new files (`touch`)
* You make changes (`nano`, `vim`, editors)
* You delete or move files

```bash
# Example
echo "Hello Git" &gt; hello.txt
```

This file now exists in your **Working Directory**, but Git isn’t tracking it yet.

---

## 🧮 2. **Staging Area (Index / Intermediate Area)**

### 📌 What It Is:

* The **Staging Area** is a **temporary holding area** where you tell Git what changes you want to **include in the next commit**.
* It allows **batching and controlling** what gets committed.
* Only the file added into this stage area will comitted(modified) and other will remain same

### 🔄 Think of It As:

&gt; “I changed multiple files, but I only want to commit these two for now.”

### 🛠️ Activities:

* Files must be added using `git add` to move them here.

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

Now, `hello.txt` is **staged** for the next commit.

🧠 **Note**: You can keep modifying a file even after staging it — those new modifications won't be part of the commit **unless** you re-stage the file.

---

## 🏛️ 3. **Repository (Git Directory / Committed Area)**

### 📌 What It Is:

* This is the **hidden `.git/` directory** that stores your **full project history** and metadata.
* Once changes are committed, they become part of the project’s **permanent version history**.

### 🛠️ Activities:

* Files are committed using:

```bash
git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

Now the file is stored in the **repository (committed)** area and can be referenced, restored, or compared in the future.

## 🔄 Full Lifecycle of a File in Git

Let’s visualize a change flowing through all three containers:

```text
             ┌────────────────────┐
             │ Working Directory  │
             │ (Edit/Create File) │
             └────────┬───────────┘
                      │ git add
                      ▼
             ┌────────────────────┐
             │  Staging Area      │
             │ (Index/Cache)      │
             └────────┬───────────┘
                      │ git commit
                      ▼
             ┌────────────────────┐
             │ Git Repository     │
             │ (.git/ directory)  │
             └────────────────────┘
```

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### 🔸 Step 1: Modify/Add a File

```bash
echo "first line" &gt; notes.txt
```

📍 Status:

* **Working Directory**: `notes.txt` is modified
* **Staging Area**: empty
* **Repository**: no record of `notes.txt`

---

### 🔸 Step 2: Stage It

```bash
git add notes.txt
```

📍 Status:

* **Working Directory**: `notes.txt` exists
* **Staging Area**: `notes.txt` is staged
* **Repository**: still no record of `notes.txt`

---

### 🔸 Step 3: Commit It

```bash
git commit -m "Add notes.txt"
```

📍 Status:

* **Working Directory**: `notes.txt` exists
* **Staging Area**: empty
* **Repository**: contains snapshot of `notes.txt`

---

### 🔸 Step 4: Modify Again

```bash
echo "second line" &gt;&gt; notes.txt
```

📍 Status:

* **Working Directory**: modified
* **Staging Area**: still contains old version
* **Repository**: still has the version with only "first line"

Now, you must **add + commit again** to update the repository.

## 📌 Git Status Commands

Use these to track the current state of files in each container:

| Command             | Shows...                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `git status`        | What’s staged, modified, or untracked       |
| `git diff`          | Changes in working directory not yet staged |
| `git diff --cached` | Changes staged but not yet committed        |

## 🧾 Summary Points

* **Working Directory**: Where files are created or modified
* **Staging Area (Index)**: Where changes are prepared before being committed
* **Git Directory (Repository)**: Where committed versions are stored permanently
* Changes **must pass through each stage** to be recorded in history
* Git provides **flexibility** to control exactly what gets committed
