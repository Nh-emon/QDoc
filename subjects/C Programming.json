It was designed as a simplified version of the <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">BCPL</span> (Basic Combined Programming Language) and was one of the precursors to the C programming language.C is the successor of B language<br><br>C programming is a general-purpose, procedural programming language developed by <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Dennis Ritchie</span> in 1972 at <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Bell Labs</span>. It's known for its efficiency, flexibility, and close interaction with hardware, making it a foundational language in the field of computer science. C provides a structured approach to programming and offers control over low-level operations, which is why it's often used for system programming, including operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.<br></p><h5 class=\"p-2 mb-2\" data-el=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Uses of C Programming :</span><br></h5><ul class=\"ul li-disk ps-4 ps-md-5 py-3\" data-el=\"list-container\"><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\"> <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Operating Systems</span>: Many operating systems, including Unix, Linux, and parts of Windows, are written in C\n</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\"><span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Embedded Systems</span>: C is widely used in programming microcontrollers and embedded systems due to its efficiency and control over hardware</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n<span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">System Software</span>: Compilers, interpreters, and drivers are often written in C</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Application Software</span>: Certain high-performance applications, such as graphics and gaming engines, are developed in C</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n<span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Database Systems</span>: C is used in the development of database systems like MySQL</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n<span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Network Programming</span>: C is used in the development of network protocols and communication systems</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Game Development</span>: Some game engines are built using C for optimized performance</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">\n<span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">High-Performance Computing</span>: C is used in scenarios where performance is critical, like in scientific simulations and financial systems</li><li data-el=\"list\" class=\"\">A real-world example of C programming is the development of the <span style=\"\" class=\"bold\">Linux kernel</span>. The Linux operating system, which powers a large percentage of servers, smartphones (via Android), and other devices, is written primarily in C. The language’s ability to directly interact with hardware, manage memory efficiently, and optimize performance makes it ideal for such a foundational piece of software.<br></li></ul><h5 class=\"p-2 mb-2\" data-el=\"title\"><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Prior Knowledge Before Learning C :</span><br></h5><p class=\"p p-2 px-3 mb-2\" data-el=\"text\">While prior programming experience is helpful, it’s not strictly necessary, as C can be your first programming language.

They provide direct control over hardware and are often specific to a particular type of processor.<br><br><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\"><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\"><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Characteristic</span>s:</span></span><br><br>1. Minimal Abstraction: These languages work closely with the hardware and provide minimal abstraction from the machine code.<br><br>2. Machine-Dependent: Low-level languages are usually machine-dependent, meaning they are designed to run on a specific type of computer architecture.<br><br>3.Performance: Programs written in low-level languages can be very fast and efficient because they allow for direct manipulation of memory and CPU registers.<br><br>4.Complexity: Writing code in a low-level language is more complex and error-prone, as it requires detailed knowledge of the hardware.<br><br>5.Examples:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Assembly Language : Uses mnemonics and is one step above machine code, making it slightly more human-readable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Machine Language&nbsp; : The lowest level, consisting of binary code (1s and 0s) that the CPU directly executes.<br><br><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Use Cases:</span><br>&nbsp;System Programming: Writing operating systems, device drivers, and firmware.<br>&nbsp;Embedded Systems&nbsp; : Programming microcontrollers and other embedded hardware.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">High-Level Languages</span><br><br>Definition: High-level languages are closer to human languages and further removed from machine code. They provide a greater level of abstraction from the hardware, making them easier to read, write, and maintain.<br><br><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Characteristics:</span><br><br>1.High Abstraction: High-level languages abstract away the details of the computer’s hardware, allowing programmers to focus more on the logic of the program.<br><br>2.Machine-Independent : Programs written in high-level languages can usually run on different types of hardware with little or no modification.<br><br>3.Ease of Use : They are designed to be easy to learn and use, with simpler syntax and more powerful features.<br><br>4.Slower Performance : Programs written in high-level languages are typically less efficient than those written in low-level languages because of the additional abstraction layers.<br><br>5.<span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Examples :</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Python: Known for its simplicity and readability.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Java: Designed to be platform-independent, running on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; C++: A more complex, feature-rich language often used in application development.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; C#, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.<br><br><span style=\"color: #ff0080;\" class=\"\">Use Cases:</span><br>&nbsp;Application Development : Building desktop, web, and mobile applications.<br>&nbsp;Data Analysis and Machine Learning : High-level languages like Python are commonly used in these fields.<br>&nbsp;Web Development: High-level languages are used for both frontend and backend web development.<br><br></div>\n        </div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"light-note p-3 rounded-1 mx-2 mb-2 text-light box-bg\">Conclusion :<br>Low-level languages provide fine-grained control over hardware, making them ideal for system-level programming where performance and efficiency are critical. High-level languages, on the other hand, prioritize ease of use and productivity, making them more suitable for application development and tasks where rapid development is more important than absolute performance.</p></div>","topic_id":21}],"chapter_id":35},{"chapter_name":"Setting Up the Development Enviroment","topics":[],"chapter_id":36}]}
