It was developed to explain the limitations of Rutherford's model, particularly regarding how electrons don't spiral into the nucleus and how atomic spectra are formed. Here's a breakdown of its main points:</p><im>https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LIJZ6Nqk-aY/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&amp;rs=AOn4CLBuhFWLgLlqn4arxCO8agEev3ln_A Borh Model Of ATOM</im></sn><sn><md data-rr=\"true\"><pre>### Bohr Model of the Atom<br><br>#### 1. **Electrons Orbit in Defined Paths**<br>   - Electrons move in specific **circular orbits** (also called shells or energy levels) around the nucleus.<br>   - These orbits are at fixed distances from the nucleus and are associated with a particular energy level.<br>   <br>#### 2. **Quantized Energy Levels**<br>   - Only certain allowed orbits exist, meaning electrons can only occupy specific energy levels. The energy of an electron in a given orbit is quantized.<br>   - Each orbit is assigned a principal quantum number, **n**, where:<br>     - **n = 1** is the closest orbit (lowest energy, ground state).<br>     - Higher **n** values represent orbits further from the nucleus (higher energy, excited states).<br>   <br>#### 3. **Energy Absorption and Emission**<br>   - Electrons can **absorb** energy and jump to higher orbits (excited state) or **emit** energy (in the form of photons) and fall back to lower orbits (ground state).<br>   - The energy difference between these orbits corresponds to the energy of the emitted or absorbed light, explaining atomic spectra (e.g., the spectral lines of hydrogen).<br><br>#### 4. **Stable Electron Orbits**<br>   - Electrons in their allowed orbits do not lose energy, which explains why they do not spiral into the nucleus, unlike what classical physics predicted.<br><br>#### Bohr's Model and Hydrogen Atom<br>   - The model was especially successful in explaining the **hydrogen atom**, where there is only one electron orbiting the nucleus. It accurately predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen observed in experiments.<br><br>#### Limitations of the Bohr Model<br>   - It only works well for hydrogen-like atoms (single-electron systems).<br>   - It does not explain the fine details of atomic spectra or electron behavior in multi-electron atoms.<br>   - It was later replaced by more advanced quantum mechanical models that account for electron wave behavior and uncertainty in their positions (e.g., Schrödinger’s wave mechanics).<br><br>The Bohr model was a significant step forward in atomic theory, leading to the development of quantum mechanics.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":218,"last_visited":"2024-10-12T10:29:43.624Z"}],"chapter_id":0}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-12T10:37:08.814Z","is_private":false,"last_update_on":"2024-10-12T10:37:08.814Z"}
