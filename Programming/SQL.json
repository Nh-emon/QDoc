FROM Table\n```\n\n### **Database Structure**\n\n**Employees table:**\n\n| Id | FName | LName  | DeptId |\n|----|------|-------|--------|\n| 1  | James | Smith | 3      |\n| 2  | John  | Johnson | 4    |\n\n**Departments table:**\n\n| Id | Name       |\n|----|------------|\n| 1  | Sales      |\n| 2  | Marketing  |\n| 3  | Finance    |\n| 4  | IT         |\n\n---\n\n### **Simple SELECT Statement**\n\n---\n\n\nThe `*` wildcard character is used to **select all available columns** in a table.\n\n- When used instead of explicit column names, it returns **all columns** from the tables specified in the `FROM` clause and any tables joined.\n  \n**Example Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM Employees;\n```\n**Result:**\n\n| Id | FName | LName  | DeptId |\n|----|------|-------|--------|\n| 1  | James | Smith | 3      |\n| 2  | John  | Johnson | 4    |\n\n---\n\n### **Dot Notation**\n\nTo select all values from a specific table while joining, use **dot notation**:\n\n**Example Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT\n  Employees.*,\n  Departments.Name\nFROM\n  Employees\nJOIN\n  Departments\nON Departments.Id = Employees.DeptId;\n```\n**Result:**\n\n| Id | FName | LName  | DeptId | Name    |\n|----|------|-------|--------|--------|\n| 1  | James | Smith | 3      | Finance |\n| 2  | John  | Johnson | 4    | IT      |\n\n---\n\n### **Warnings Against Use of `*`**\n\nIt is generally **advised to avoid using `*` in production code** due to potential issues:\n\n1. **Excess Resource Usage**:  \n   - Increases I/O, network load, memory usage by fetching unnecessary columns (e.g., large fields like notes/files).\n  \n2. **Internal Disk Spooling**:  \n   - May cause extra I/O if intermediate results are written to disk during complex query processing.\n\n3. **Unnecessary Processing**:  \n   - Includes unneeded columns such as:\n     - Computed columns.\n     - Columns from views/tables that could be optimized out.\n\n4. **Ambiguous Column Names**:  \n   - If columns are added later, duplicate column names can cause errors.  \n   - Example:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT * \n     FROM orders \n     JOIN people ON people.id = orders.personid \n     ORDER BY displayname;\n     ```\n     If `displayname` is added to both tables, ambiguity or unexpected behavior may occur.\n\n---\n\n### **When Is It Acceptable to Use `*`?**\n\n- **Manual Queries / Investigation / Prototyping**:  \n  Fine for quick checks and exploration.\n  \n- **Design Necessities**:  \n  If unavoidable, prefer `tablealias.*` over plain `*`.\n\n- **In `EXISTS` Clauses**:  \n  Example:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT A.col1, A.col2 \n  FROM A \n  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM B WHERE A.ID = B.A_ID);\n  ```\n  No data is returned from table B, so using `*` here is safe.\n\n- **In `COUNT(*)` Queries**:  \n  Safe, as it does not return columns but counts rows.\n</md></sn>","topic_id":774,"last_visited":"2025-03-24T13:25:16.132Z"},{"topic_name":"02.Select Using Column Aliases","topic_html":"<sn><pre data-v=\"sql\">-- Preferred standard syntax (best practice, portable)\nSELECT column AS c1 FROM Table;\n\n-- Standard SQL (supports spaces/reserved words in alias)\nSELECT column AS \"c1\" FROM Table;\n\n-- SQL Server specific: uses single quotes for alias (less common)\nSELECT column AS 'c1' FROM Table;\n\n-- SQL Server specific: uses square brackets for alias\nSELECT column AS [c1] FROM Table;\n\n-- SQL Server specific non-standard syntax (discouraged)\nSELECT c1 = column FROM Table;\n</pre></sn><sn><md class=\"p-1 p-md-2 my-2\" data-rr=\"true\">## **SELECT Using Column Aliases**\n\n### **Purpose of Column Aliases**\nColumn aliases are used to:\n- **Shorten code** and improve readability.\n- **Avoid repetitive long table names**.\n- **Clarify column names**, especially when tables have multiple similar columns (e.g., two IDs).\n- **Assign names to computed columns** (required in views and complex queries).\n\nUsing aliases allows database structures to use longer, descriptive names, while keeping queries concise.\n\n---\n\n### **Syntax: All SQL Versions**\n\nColumn aliases can be created using **double quotes (\"\")**:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  FName AS \"First Name\",\n  MName AS \"Middle Name\",\n  LName AS \"Last Name\"\nFROM Employees;\n```\n\n---\n\n### **SQL Server Specific Syntax**\n\nIn **Microsoft SQL Server**, aliases can be created using:\n- Single quotes (`'`)\n- Double quotes (`\"`)\n- Square brackets (`[]`)\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  FName AS \"First Name\",\n  MName AS 'Middle Name',\n  LName AS [Last Name]\nFROM Employees;\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n| First Name | Middle Name | Last Name |\n|-----------|------------|---------|\n| James     | John        | Smith   |\n| John      | James       | Johnson |\n| Michael   | Marcus      | Williams |\n\n---\n\n### **Without AS Operator**\n\nYou can omit the `AS` keyword.

`Orders.Id AS OrderId`: The `Id` field of the `Orders` table will be returned with the alias **OrderId**.\n  - **Column Aliases**: Useful for renaming columns in the result.\n\n---\n\n### Using Table Aliases\nTo avoid writing long table names repeatedly (especially in joins), **table aliases** are used.\n\n**Example with Aliases**:\n```sql\nSELECT\n    c.PhoneNumber,\n    c.Email,\n    c.PreferredContact,\n    o.Id AS OrderId\nFROM\n    Customers AS c\nLEFT JOIN\n    Orders AS o ON o.CustomerId = c.Id;\n```\n- **Alias Usage**:\n  - `Customers AS c`: `c` is an alias for `Customers`.\n  - `Orders AS o`: `o` is an alias for `Orders`.\n  - Fields are now accessed like `c.Email` or `o.Id`.\n- **Note**:  \n  In **self joins**, aliases are mandatory to distinguish between the two instances of the same table.\n</md></sn>","topic_id":776,"last_visited":"2025-03-24T13:49:59.208Z"}],"chapter_id":200}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2025-03-24T10:27:26.644Z","is_private":false,"folder":"Programming","web_url":"http://qdoc.free.nf","nameKeys":["chapter_name","topic_name"],"last_update_on":"2025-03-24T13:50:01.937Z"}
