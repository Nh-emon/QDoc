It is supported by databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle but is not available in SQL Server.\n  \n  Example using `NATURAL JOIN`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Fname, LName, ManagerFirstName\nFROM Employees\nNATURAL JOIN\n    (SELECT Id AS ManagerId, Fname AS ManagerFirstName\n     FROM Managers) m;\n```\n- **Explanation**:  \n  - `NATURAL JOIN`: Automatically resolves column name conflicts when columns share the same name (like `Fname` or `LName`) between the two tables.\n  - **Alias for Derived Table**: The subquery for `Managers` uses the alias `m`, which is required, but does not affect the query logic.</md></sn>","topic_id":777,"last_visited":"2025-03-26T06:20:52.248Z"}],"chapter_id":200},{"chapter_name":"20.Create Database","topics":[{"topic_name":"CREATE DATABASE","topic_html":"<sn><md class=\"p-1 p-md-2 my-2\" data-rr=\"true\">### **CREATE Database**\n\nIn SQL, you can create a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.
