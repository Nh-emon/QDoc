It‚Äôs widely used in documentation, web content, and README files.  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Basics of Markdown**\nMarkdown uses simple symbols and text formatting conventions.  \n\n#### **1.1. Headings**\nUse `#` for headings. Add more `#` for smaller headings.  \n```markdown\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n#### Heading 4\n##### Heading 5\n###### Heading 6\n```\n\n#### **1.2. Emphasis**  \n- *Italic*: Use `*text*` or `_text_`  \n- **Bold**: Use `**text**` or `__text__`  \n- ***Bold + Italic***: Use `***text***` or `___text___`  \n```markdown\n*Italic*  \n**Bold**  \n***Bold + Italic***\n```\n\n#### **1.3. Lists**  \n- **Unordered Lists**: Use `-`, `*`, or `+`.  \n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Sub-item 2.1\n  - Sub-item 2.2\n```\n\n- **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period (`1.`, `2.`).  \n```markdown\n1. First\n2. Second\n   1. Nested\n   2. Nested\n```\n\n#### **1.4. Links and Images**  \n- **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)`  \n- **Images**: `![Alt Text](Image URL)`  \n```markdown\n[Google](https://www.google.com)  \n![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Intermediate Markdown**  \n\n#### **2.1. Blockquotes**  \nUse `&gt;` for blockquotes.  \n```markdown\n&gt; This is a blockquote.  \n&gt;&gt; Nested blockquote.  \n```\n\n#### **2.2. Code Blocks**  \n- **Inline Code**: Use backticks (\\`) around the text.  \n```markdown\n`Inline code example`\n```\n\n- **Multiline Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks (```) or indent with four spaces.  \n```markdown\n```\nCode block example\n```\n```\n\n#### **2.3. Horizontal Rules**  \nUse three or more dashes (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`).  \n```markdown\n---\n```\n\n#### **2.4. Tables**  \nUse `|` and `-` to create tables.  \n```markdown\n| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Row 1    | Data 1   | Data 2   |\n| Row 2    | Data 3   | Data 4   |\n```\n\n#### **2.5. Task Lists**  \nUse `- [ ]` for unchecked and `- [x]` for checked tasks.  \n```markdown\n- [x] Task 1\n- [ ] Task 2\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Advanced Markdown**  \n\n#### **3.1. Escaping Characters**  \nUse a backslash (`\\`) before special Markdown characters to escape them.  \n```markdown\n\\*This is not italicized\\*\n```\n\n#### **3.2. Footnotes**  \nAdd a reference like `[^1]` and the footnote text elsewhere.  \n```markdown\nHere is a footnote reference[^1].\n\n[^1]: This is the footnote text.\n```\n\n#### **3.3. Strikethrough**  \nUse `~~text~~` for strikethrough.  \n```markdown\n~~This text is strikethrough~~\n```\n\n#### **3.4. Definition Lists**  \nUse a colon (`:`) followed by a definition.  \n```markdown\nTerm 1\n: Definition 1\n\nTerm 2\n: Definition 2\n```\n\n#### **3.5. HTML in Markdown**  \nYou can embed raw HTML when needed.  \n```markdown\n&lt;div style=\"color: red;\"&gt;This is a red text.&lt;/div&gt;\n```\n\n#### **3.6. Automatic Linking**  \nUse angle brackets for automatic URLs.  \n```markdown\n&lt;https://www.google.com&gt;\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Markdown Cheatsheet**\n\n| Syntax                  | Description                                    |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| `# Heading`             | Creates a heading. Add more `#` for smaller ones. |\n| `*Italic*`              | Italics (also `_text_`).                      |\n| `**Bold**`              | Bold (also `__text__`).                       |\n| `***Bold + Italic***`   | Combination of bold and italic.               |\n| `- Item`                | Creates an unordered list.                    |\n| `1.

Like Muhammad, he was born after the death of\nhis father. As a child, he showed considerable mechanical aptitude, and was very clever with his hands.\nAlthough a bright child, he was inattentive in school and did not attract much attention. When he was a\nteenager, his mother took him out of school, hoping that he would become a successful farmer. Fortunately,\nshe was persuaded that his principal talents lay elsewhere, and at eighteen, he entered Cambridge\nUniversity. There, he rapidly absorbed what was then known of science and mathematics, and soon moved\non to his own independent research. Between his twenty-first and twenty-seventh years, he laid the\nfoundations for the scientific theories that subsequently revolutionized the world.\nThe middle of the seventeenth century was a period of great scientific ferment.

Still, pure science was\nlargely a plaything of intellectuals, and as yet there was no proof that when applied to technology,\nscience could revolutionize the whole mode of human life, as Francis Bacon had predicted.\nAlthough Copernicus and Galileo had swept aside some of the misconceptions of ancient\nscience and contributed to a greater understanding of the universe, no set of principles had been\nformulated that could turn this collection of seemingly unrelated facts into a unified theory with\nwhich to make scientific predictions. It was Isaac Newton who supplied that unified theory and set\nmodern science on the course which it has followed ever since.</p></sn><sn class=\"bar indigo\"><p>Newton was always reluctant to publish his results, and although he had formulated the basic ideas\nbehind most of his work by 1669, many of his theories were not made public until much later. The\nfirst of his discoveries to be published was his ground-breaking work on the nature of light. In a\nseries of careful experiments, Newton had discovered that ordinary white light is a mixture of all\nthe colors of the rainbow. He had also made a careful analysis of the consequences of the laws of\nthe reflection and refraction of light. Using these laws, he had in 1668 designed and actually built\nthe first reflecting telescope, the type of telescope that is used in most major astronomical obser</p></sn>","topic_id":743,"last_visited":"2025-02-16T05:28:15.307Z"}],"chapter_id":195}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2025-02-02T14:33:56.844Z","is_private":false,"folder":"Programming","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2025-02-16T06:08:41.393Z"}
