It seems you're referring to **Newton's Third Law of Motion**, a fundamental principle in classical mechanics. I'll explain the law, provide its mathematical formulation, and discuss its justification.\n\n---\n\n### **Newton's Third Law of Motion**\n\n**Statement:**\n> *For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.*\n\nIn other words, if Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on Object A.\n\n---\n\n### **Mathematical Formulation**\n\nLetâ€™s denote the forces between two objects:\n\n- **\\( \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} \\)**: The force exerted by Object A on Object B.\n- **\\( \\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A} \\)**: The force exerted by Object B on Object A.\n\nAccording to Newton's Third Law:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} = -\\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A}\n\\]\n\nThis equation signifies that the forces are equal in magnitude (**\\( |\\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B}| = |\\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A}| \\)**) and opposite in direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Illustrative Example**\n\n**Consider Two Ice Skaters Pushing Off Each Other:**\n\n1. **Initial State:** Both skaters are at rest on frictionless ice.\n2. **Action:** Skater A pushes skater B with a force \\( \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} \\).\n3. **Reaction:** Simultaneously, skater B pushes back on skater A with force \\( \\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A} = -\\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} \\).\n\nAs a result, both skaters move in opposite directions with accelerations inversely proportional to their masses.\n\n---\n\n### **Proof and Justification**\n\n**Conceptual Understanding:**\n\nNewton's Third Law arises from the conservation of momentum. When two objects interact, the total momentum of the system remains constant if no external forces act upon it.\n\n**Mathematical Justification:**\n\n1. **Conservation of Momentum:**\n   \n   For two interacting objects, the total momentum before interaction equals the total momentum after interaction.\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{p}_{\\text{total, initial}} = \\mathbf{p}_{\\text{total, final}}\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow m_A \\mathbf{v}_{A, \\text{initial}} + m_B \\mathbf{v}_{B, \\text{initial}} = m_A \\mathbf{v}_{A, \\text{final}} + m_B \\mathbf{v}_{B, \\text{final}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Impulse-Momentum Theorem:**\n   \n   The change in momentum is equal to the impulse applied.\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_A = \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} \\Delta t\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_B = \\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A} \\Delta t\n   \\]\n\n3. **From Conservation of Momentum:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_A + \\Delta \\mathbf{p}_B = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   Substituting the impulses:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} \\Delta t + \\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A} \\Delta t = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} + \\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A} = 0\n   \\]\n   \n   \\[\n   \\Rightarrow \\mathbf{F}_{A \\rightarrow B} = -\\mathbf{F}_{B \\rightarrow A}\n   \\]\n   \nThis derivation shows that the forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum, thereby justifying Newton's Third Law.\n\n---\n\n### **Important Considerations**\n\n1. **Simultaneity:** The action and reaction forces occur simultaneously.\n2. **Different Objects:** The two forces act on different objects, not on the same object.\n3. **No Net Force:** While each force pair is equal and opposite, they do not cancel out because they act on separate bodies.\n\n---\n\n### **Applications**\n\n- **Rocket Propulsion:** Rockets expel gas backward (action), and the gas exerts an equal and opposite force pushing the rocket forward (reaction).\n- **Walking:** When you push the ground backward with your foot (action), the ground pushes you forward with an equal and opposite force (reaction).\n- **Swimming:** Pushing water backward propels the swimmer forward.\n\n---\n\n### **Limitations and Extensions**\n\nWhile Newton's Third Law holds true in classical mechanics, certain phenomena in modern physics (like electromagnetic interactions and quantum mechanics) require more nuanced explanations. For example, in electromagnetic fields, forces can be mediated by field interactions, and the notion of action at a distance is replaced by field dynamics.\n\n---\n\nI hope this provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of Newton's Third Law of Motion, complete with its formula and justification.
