In 1902, Leon Teisserenc de Bort discovered that this decrease stops around 8–12 km, where temperature levels off. Further balloon and rocket studies revealed the atmosphere’s layered temperature structure, leading to its division into four main layers.</p><p style="border-top:3px solid rgb(var(--teal-500))" class="bar bar-teal m-3">Earth’s atmosphere is traditionally divided into four layers, based on temperature.</p><im class="bg-teal-100">https://i.imgur.com/ZWB94b6.png^^figure</im><tb class="py-2 bg-pink-100"><pre>| <strong>Altitude Range (km)</strong> | <strong>Temperature Range (°C)</strong> | <strong>Layer Name</strong> | <strong>Key Characteristics</strong> |
| ---  | ---  | ---  | --- |
| 0 – 12 | 15 to -60 | Troposphere | Weather occurs, temperature decreases with altitude. Contains ~75% of the atmosphere. |
| 12 – 50 | -60 to 0 | Stratosphere | Contains the ozone layer; temperature increases due to UV absorption. |
| 50 – 80 | 0 to -100 | Mesosphere | Coldest layer; meteors burn up here. Temperature decreases with altitude. |
| 80 – 700+ | -100 to 1500+ | Thermosphere | Temperature rises sharply due to solar radiation. ISS orbits here. |
| &gt; 700 | Varies (near vacuum) | Exosphere | Merges with space; very few molecules. Satellites and auroras occur in lower parts. |

<li><strong>Troposphere</strong> – Closest to Earth, where life and weather exist.</li>
<li><strong>Stratosphere</strong> – Stable, dry layer; jets often fly here.</li>
<li><strong>Mesosphere</strong> – Protects Earth from meteoroids.</li>
