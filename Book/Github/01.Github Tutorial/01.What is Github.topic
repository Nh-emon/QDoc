4. **Commit**: Save changes locally with a message.
5. **Push**: Send local changes to GitHub.
6. **Pull**: Bring changes from GitHub to your local machine.
7. **Branches**: Create separate lines of development.
8. **Merge**: Combine branches together.
9. **Pull Requests**: Request to merge code into another branch (often main).
10. **Collaborate**: Others can review, suggest changes, and contribute.
