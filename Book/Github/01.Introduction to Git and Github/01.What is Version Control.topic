<sn><md>### 🧠 What is Version Control?

**Version Control** is a system that helps you **track changes to files over time**, especially source code. It allows multiple people to **collaborate**, **revert to previous versions**, and **manage updates** without overwriting each other’s work.

---

### 🔧 Key Features:

* 📜 **Track History**: Every change is recorded—who made it, when, and what was changed.
* 👥 **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
* 🔁 **Rollback Capability**: Restore previous versions of your files at any time.
* 🌱 **Branching**: Work on new features or experiments without affecting the main code.
* ⚔️ **Merge and Conflict Resolution**: Integrate changes from different contributors.

### 📦 Two Main Types:

| Type                | Description                               | Example Tools  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Centralized VCS** | Single central server stores all versions | SVN, CVS       |
| **Distributed VCS** | Each developer has a full repo copy       | Git, Mercurial |

### ✅ Why Use Version Control?

* Prevents accidental file loss or overwriting
* Enhances teamwork and accountability
* Maintains a clean development history
