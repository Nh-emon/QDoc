---

1. **Crushing and Grinding:**
   The copper ore (usually **chalcopyrite**, CuFeS₂) is crushed and ground into fine powder to prepare it for further processing.

2. **Concentration of Ore:**
   The powdered ore is concentrated by **froth flotation**, which separates copper-containing minerals from gangue (waste materials).

3. **Conversion to Metal Oxide (Roasting):**
   The concentrated sulfide ore is **roasted in air**, converting part of it to **copper oxide (Cu₂O)** and releasing **SO₂ gas**.
   Example:

   $$
   2CuFeS_2 + O_2 → Cu_2S + 2FeS + SO_2
   $$

4. **Reduction of Metal Oxide (Smelting &amp; Self-Reduction):**
   Copper oxide (Cu₂O) reacts with remaining copper sulfide (Cu₂S) in a **self-reduction** reaction to produce **blister copper** (\~98–99% pure).

   $$
   Cu_2O + Cu_2S → 6Cu + SO_2↑
   $$

5. **Refining of Copper:**
   Blister copper is refined by **electrolysis**. Pure copper is deposited at the **cathode**, while impurities fall off as **anode mud**.

   $$
   Cu^{2+} + 2e^- → Cu \quad (\text{at cathode})
   $$

Copper is a relatively abundant metal in the Earth’s crust (about **0.0068% by weight**) and occurs in both **native (free)** and **combined forms**. Due to its low reactivity, it is sometimes found in the **metallic state**, but more commonly in **combined ores**.

---

### **1. Forms of Occurrence**

#### **a) Native Copper (Free State):**

* Found in small quantities in **oxidized zones** of copper deposits.
* Occurs in metallic form, especially in arid regions.
* Example: Native copper (Cu)

#### **b) Combined State (Ores):**

| **Ore Name**      | **Chemical Formula** | **Ore Type** |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| **Chalcopyrite**  | CuFeS₂               | Sulfide      |
| **Copper Glance** | Cu₂S                 | Sulfide      |
| **Cuprite**       | Cu₂O                 | Oxide        |
| **Malachite**     | CuCO₃·Cu(OH)₂        | Carbonate    |
| **Azurite**       | 2CuCO₃·Cu(OH)₂       | Carbonate    |

---

### **2. Geological Occurrence**

* Copper ores are usually found in **igneous and sedimentary rocks**.
* Often occurs in **vein deposits**, **porphyry copper deposits**, and **volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS)** systems.
* Commonly associated with **zinc, lead, gold, and silver**.

### **3. Major Producing Countries**

| **Country**   | **Major Mining Regions**        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Chile**     | World’s largest copper producer |
| **USA**       | Arizona, Utah                   |
| **Peru**      | Andes Mountains                 |
| **China**     | Jiangxi, Yunnan                 |
| **Australia** | Mount Isa                       |
| **India**     | Rajasthan (Khetri, Malanjkhand) |

### **Conclusion**

Copper is found both in native form and more commonly in various chemical combinations. **Chalcopyrite (CuFeS₂)** is the **most important commercial ore**, and significant deposits are mined worldwide to meet the high industrial demand for this versatile metal.
