---

Noble gases, also known as Group 18 elements in the periodic table, include **Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn)**. This summary will focus on the **chemistry of noble gases excluding Xenon**, i.e., **He, Ne, Ar, Kr**, and **Rn**.

### 1. **General Characteristics of Noble Gases**

| Property                 | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Electronic Configuration | ns² np⁶ (except He: 1s²)                                     |
| Reactivity               | Very low (inert gases)                                       |
| Atomicity                | Monatomic                                                    |
| Physical State           | Colorless, odorless gases                                    |
| Boiling Points           | Very low due to weak Van der Waals forces                    |
| Solubility               | Slightly soluble in water                                    |
| Occurrence               | Found in the atmosphere (He, Ne, Ar), radioactive decay (Rn) |

### 2. **Reasons for Inertness**

* `Complete Octet` Their outermost shell is completely filled (except He with 1s²), making them stable.
* `High Ionization Energy` Difficult to remove electrons.
* `Zero Electronegativity` (or very low):** Do not attract electrons.
* `No tendency to form bonds`

### 3. **Chemical Inertness – Observations**

| Noble Gas   | Chemical Reactivity      | Observations                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Helium**  | Chemically inert         | No known compounds                                                                |
| **Neon**    | Chemically inert         | No known compounds                                                                |
| **Argon**   | Extremely inert          | Some physical interactions (clathrates)                                           |
| **Krypton** | Very slightly reactive   | Can form compounds with Fluorine under special conditions                         |
| **Radon**   | Predicted to be reactive | Some unstable fluorides have been reported, but it's radioactive and less studied |

### 4. **Clathrate Compounds**

Although noble gases do not form **true chemical compounds** (except Kr and Rn), some can form **clathrates**:

* **Definition:** Physical compounds where `gas atoms are trapped in cavities` of water or hydrocarbon frameworks.
* **Examples:**

  * Argon, Krypton, and Xenon can form clathrates with water or quinol.
  * Helium and Neon **do not form** clathrates due to their small size.

### 5. **Compounds of Krypton and Radon**

Although rare and formed under extreme conditions:

#### Krypton Compounds

* **Krypton Difluoride (`KrF₂`)** – First compound of Krypton discovered.
* Prepared by:

  * Kr + F₂ → KrF₂ (under electric discharge or UV light at low temp)
* Properties:

  * Powerful `oxidizing agent`.
  * Stable at room temperature.

#### Radon Compounds

* Some reports of **Radon Fluorides (RnF₂)**.
* `Highly radioactive`, hence limited chemistry.
* Likely exists in `+2 oxidation state`.

---

### 6. **Why Xenon is Different**

* `Larger atomic size` and `lower ionization energy` make it more chemically reactive than other noble gases.
* Forms a variety of compounds: XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆, XeO₃, etc.
* Not covered in this answer as per the request.

### 7. **Conclusion**

Noble gases (except Xenon) are mostly chemically **inert** due to their `full valence shells`, `high ionization energies`, and `low polarizability`. While **Helium, Neon, and Argon** are completely inert under standard conditions, `Krypton and Radon` show `limited reactivity` under extreme conditions, mostly forming `fluorides`.
