---

### Introduction

Group 16 of the periodic table, known as the `chalcogens`, comprises the elements:

`O S Se Te Po Lv`

**Oxygen (O), Sulfur (S), Selenium (Se), Tellurium (Te), Polonium (Po)**, and **Livermorium (Lv)**.
Among these, **oxygen and sulfur** play the most significant roles in both inorganic and biological chemistry. Oxygen is vital for `life and combustion`, while sulfur is essential in `industrial processes and biological systems`.

This article focuses on the **general chemistry of Group 16** with a detailed emphasis on **oxygen and sulfur**, covering their occurrence, physical and chemical properties, oxides, hydrides, and biological/industrial relevance.

### Allotropes

`Same element different atomic arrangement`.

**Oxygen:**

### Hydrides

**General formula**: H₂E (E = group 16 element)

| Hydride | Boiling Point | Bond Angle | Nature           |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| H₂O     | High (100°C)  | 104.5°     | Hydrogen bonding |
| H₂S     | –60°C         | \~92°      | No H-bonding     |

**Oxygen (H₂O):**

* Strong **hydrogen bonding** leads to unusually high boiling point
* Acts as a universal solvent and medium for biochemical reactions

**Sulfur (H₂S):**

* Weakly acidic and highly toxic gas
* No hydrogen bonding; more volatile and less polar than water

**Acid Strength Trend:**
H₂O &lt; H₂S &lt; H₂Se &lt; H₂Te

---

### Oxides

**Oxygen forms:**

* **CO, CO₂, NO, NO₂, SO₂, SO₃**, etc.
* Most oxides are **acidic or amphoteric**
* **CO₂** is a linear molecule, **soluble in water** to form carbonic acid

**Sulfur forms:**

* **SO₂ (Sulfur dioxide):** Colorless gas, pungent smell, acidic oxide
  $SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃$
* **SO₃ (Sulfur trioxide):** Forms **H₂SO₄**, a strong acid
  $SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄$

Sulfur oxides are used in manufacturing of **sulfuric acid**, an industrially essential compound.

### Oxyacids of Sulfur

| Acid              | Formula | Oxidation State of S | Notes                                     |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Sulfurous acid    | H₂SO₃   | +4                   | Unstable; exists in solution              |
| Sulfuric acid     | H₂SO₄   | +6                   | Strong dibasic acid                       |
| Thiosulfuric acid | H₂S₂O₃  | +2, +6               | Contains one sulfur atom replacing oxygen |

Oxygen does **not form oxyacids**, unlike sulfur which forms a range of stable and industrially important acids.

### Biological and Industrial Importance

**Oxygen:**

* Essential for **aerobic respiration**
* Used in **welding**, **medicine**, **rocket fuels**
* Involved in **oxidative metabolism** and **photosynthesis**

**Sulfur:**

### Conclusion

The chemistry of **Group 16 elements** is both diverse and essential, but **oxygen and sulfur** stand out due to their unique properties and widespread roles in both nature and industry. Oxygen's high electronegativity and hydrogen bonding capability make it vital to life processes, while sulfur’s versatile oxidation states and complex acid chemistry make it central to industrial applications.

<sn><md data-e="true">### Two Important Questions from Group 16 with Answers

---

#### **1. Why does the metallic character increase from oxygen to polonium in Group 16 elements? Explain with reference to their position in the periodic table.**

**Answer:**

As we move down Group 16 (oxygen family) from oxygen (O) to polonium (Po), the atomic size increases due to the addition of electron shells. This leads to a `decrease in ionization energy and electronegativity`. As a result, the elements more readily lose electrons, a property typical of metals.

* **Oxygen and sulfur** are `nonmetals`.
* **Selenium and tellurium** show `metalloid characteristics`.
* **Polonium** exhibits `metallic` properties.

Thus, the increasing ease of electron loss and decreasing non-metallic character cause the elements to become more metallic down the group.

---

#### **2. Compare the oxidizing power of oxygen and sulfur. Why is oxygen a stronger oxidizing agent than sulfur, despite both belonging to Group 16?**

**Answer:**

Oxygen is a much stronger oxidizing agent than sulfur due to:

1. `Higher electronegativity`: Oxygen (3.44) is more electronegative than sulfur (2.58), so it attracts electrons more strongly.
2. `Smaller atomic size`: Oxygen has a smaller atomic and ionic radius, making it more effective at accepting electrons.
3. `Higher bond enthalpy`: The O=O double bond in O₂ is weaker compared to S₈ rings, so oxygen molecules break more easily to form oxide ions.
4. `Formation of stable O²⁻ ions`: Oxygen readily gains two electrons to form O²⁻ ions, which are highly stable due to their small size and high charge density.

Therefore, oxygen is more efficient in gaining electrons and oxidizing other substances, making it a stronger oxidizing agent than sulfur.
