### 1. Compare the chemical reactivities of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals with water. *(2 Marks)*

**Answer:**

* **Alkali metals (Group 1):** React vigorously with cold water to form **hydroxides** and **hydrogen gas**.
  Example:
  $2Na + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2NaOH + H_2 \uparrow$

* **Alkaline earth metals (Group 2):** React **less vigorously**, and their reactivity increases down the group.
  Example:
  $Ca + 2H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2 + H_2 \uparrow$

**Comparison:**

* Alkali metals react more rapidly and violently than alkaline earth metals due to their **lower ionization energy** and **greater ease of losing one electron**.

### 2. Write a note on the anomalous properties of boron compared to other Group 3A elements. *(3 Marks)*

**Answer:**
Boron shows distinct behavior from other Group 3A elements due to its **small size**, **high ionization energy**, and **absence of d-orbitals**:

* **Non-metallic nature:** Unlike metallic Al, Ga, In, and Tl, boron is a **metalloid**.
* **Covalent bonding:** Boron forms **only covalent** compounds; others form ionic ones.
* **Insolubility:** Boron compounds are generally **insoluble in water**, unlike Al compounds.
* **Acidic oxides:** Boron oxide (B₂O₃) is acidic, while Al₂O₃ is amphoteric.

These anomalous properties arise from its unique **electronic configuration (1s² 2s² 2p¹)** and **small atomic radius**.

### 3. Discuss the similarities and differences between carbon and silicon. *(3 Marks)*

**Answer:**

**Similarities:**

* Both are **Group 4A (14)** elements.
* Exhibit a **+4 oxidation state** in most of their compounds.
* Form **tetrahedral covalent compounds**, e.g., CH₄ and SiH₄.
* Both form **dioxides**: CO₂ and SiO₂.

**Differences:**

| Property   | Carbon (C)           | Silicon (Si)                    |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Bonding    | Forms strong π bonds | Does not form π bonds easily    |
| Oxide      | CO₂ is gas           | SiO₂ is solid, network compound |
| Allotropes | Diamond, graphite    | Crystalline and amorphous Si    |
| Solubility | CO₂ soluble in water | SiO₂ insoluble in water         |

Carbon shows **catenation and multiple bonding** more readily than silicon.

### 4. Explain the trends in acidity and oxidizing nature of oxoacids of halogens. *(4 Marks)*

**Answer:**
**Acidity:**

* Oxoacids of halogens become **more acidic** with increasing **oxidation state** of the halogen.
* Order of acidity:
  $HOCl &lt; HClO_2 &lt; HClO_3 &lt; HClO_4$

Reason: Higher oxidation state increases **electronegativity** of the central atom, pulling electron density and making **O–H bond more polar**, thus more acidic.

**Oxidizing Nature:**

* **Lower oxidation state oxoacids** (e.g., HOCl) are **stronger oxidizing agents** than higher ones.
* This is because they can be more easily reduced (gain electrons), which is the basis of oxidizing behavior.

**Trend Summary:**

* Acidity **increases** with oxidation state.
* Oxidizing power **decreases** with oxidation state.

### 5. How do nitrogen and phosphorus differ in their bonding and oxidation states? *(3 Marks)*

**Answer:**

**Bonding:**

* **Nitrogen:**

  * Forms **multiple bonds (π-bonds)** such as in N₂ (triple bond).
  * Exists as diatomic molecule (N≡N).
  * Cannot expand its octet due to absence of d-orbitals.

* **Phosphorus:**

  * Rarely forms multiple bonds.
  * Exists as **P₄ molecules** (single bonds, tetrahedral).
  * Can expand octet (has d-orbitals), forming compounds like PCl₅, P₂O₅.

**Oxidation States:**

* **Nitrogen:** –3 to +5 (e.g., NH₃, NO, NO₂, HNO₃)
* **Phosphorus:** Also –3 to +5 (e.g., PH₃, PCl₃, PCl₅), but **+3 and +5** states are more stable than in nitrogen.

**Conclusion:**
Nitrogen favors **π-bonding** and **smaller coordination numbers**, while phosphorus shows **expanded valency** and prefers **σ-bonding**.
