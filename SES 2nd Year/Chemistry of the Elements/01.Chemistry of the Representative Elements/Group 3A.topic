---

### Introduction

Group 13 elements, also known as the **boron family**, include:
**Boron (B), Aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), Indium (In),** and **Thallium (Tl)**.

Among these, **boron and aluminum** are the most important due to their unique chemistry and wide range of applications. Boron is a metalloid with properties distinct from the metals in the group, while aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust and extensively used industrially.

This article focuses on the general chemistry of Group 13 elements, with special emphasis on **boron and aluminum**.

### Electronic Configuration and General Trends

* Outer electronic configuration: **ns² np¹**
* Common oxidation state: +3 (though thallium shows +1)
* Boron is a metalloid; aluminum and the rest are metals.

| Element  | Atomic Number | Electronic Configuration |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Boron    | 5             | \[He] 2s² 2p¹            |
| Aluminum | 13            | \[Ne] 3s² 3p¹            |

**Trends Down the Group:**

* Atomic and ionic size **increases**.
* Metallic character **increases** from B to Tl.
* Electronegativity decreases (B = 2.0, Al = 1.5).
* Boron exhibits **covalent bonding** while aluminum forms mostly **ionic or metallic bonds**.
* Stability of +3 oxidation state is common; however, Tl shows inert pair effect leading to +1 state.

### Occurrence and Physical Properties

**Boron:**

* Found mainly in borates like borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O) and kernite.
* Rare and hard, with a high melting point.
* Poor electrical conductor.

**Aluminum:**

* Third most abundant element in Earth's crust.
* Found mainly as **bauxite ore** (Al₂O₃·2H₂O).
* Light metal with good conductivity and corrosion resistance.

### Allotropes

**Boron:**

* Exists as amorphous and crystalline forms.
* Crystalline boron has complex icosahedral structures.
* Very hard and brittle.

**Aluminum:**

* Exists only in metallic form.
* Soft, malleable, ductile metal with silvery-white appearance.

### Chemical Properties

* Both form **+3 oxidation state** compounds.
* Boron exhibits **electron-deficient bonding** (e.g., in boranes).
* Aluminum reacts with oxygen forming a protective oxide layer.
* Boron compounds are mostly covalent, aluminum compounds are ionic or amphoteric.

### Important Compounds

**Boron's Compounds:**

* **Boron hydrides (boranes):** B₂H₆ and other clusters with electron-deficient bonds.
* **Boron halides:** BF₃, BCl₃, which are Lewis acids.
* **Boric acid (H₃BO₃):** Weak acid used in antiseptics and glass making.

**Aluminum's Compounds:**

* **Aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃):** Amphoteric oxide used as abrasive and catalyst support.
* **Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃):** Lewis acid used in Friedel-Crafts reactions.
* **Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃):** Used as an antacid and in water purification.

### Hydrides

* **Boranes (BxHy):** Unique electron-deficient compounds with cluster structures.
* **Alane (AlH₃):** Less stable and less common, acts as a reducing agent.

### Applications

**Boron:**

* Used in borosilicate glass, detergents, and as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.
* Boron fibers in advanced composite materials.

**Aluminum:**

* Widely used in aerospace, packaging, construction, and electrical industries.
* Important for its lightweight, corrosion resistance, and recyclability.
