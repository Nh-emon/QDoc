A **base map** serves as the `fundamental background reference` for all other geographic or thematic information. It `provides a framework` that shows the `basic geographic context of an area`, such as roads, rivers, boundaries, topography, and other landmarks. Base maps are essential for `orientation`, `navigation`, and providing `spatial relationships among features`.
Common examples include `topographic` maps, `cadastral` maps, and `political` boundary maps.

### Thematic Map

A **thematic map** focuses on a `particular theme or subject` matter rather than general geographic information. It represents the `spatial distribution of specific data` such as population density, rainfall, soil type, land use, or vegetation. Thematic maps are `derived using base maps` to show the location and pattern of a theme.
Examples include population `density` maps, `climate` maps, and `land use/land cover` maps.

<sn><md>### Purpose of a Map

The **purpose of a map** is to `represent spatial information visually` for easy understanding, analysis, and decision-making. Maps `simplify complex data into a visual format`, making it easier to interpret spatial patterns and relationships. The main purposes include:

* Representation of the `Earth's surface features`.
* `Navigation` and `route` planning.
* `Resource` management 
* `environmental` ,`Urban` and `regional` ++planning++.
* Communication of scientific or `statistical information`.

### Map Scale

**Map scale** indicates the `ratio between a distance on the map and the corresponding distance on the ground`. It helps determine the `level of detail and area coverage of a map`.
There are `three` main types of scales:

1. **Verbal scale** (e.g.,`1 cm equals 1 km`)
2. **Representative fraction (RF)** (e.g., 1:50,000)
3. **Graphic scale (bar scale)**, which shows distances visually using a `line marked in units`.

++Large-scale maps++ (e.g., 1:10,000) show `small areas` with more detail, <br>while ++small-scale maps++ (e.g., 1:1,000,000) show `large areas` with less detail.

In Bangladesh, `various organizations and agencies` are responsible for producing and maintaining maps for different purposes such as land management, urban planning, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The major **map sources in Bangladesh** include:

* **Survey of Bangladesh (SOB):** The national mapping agency responsible for topographic and cadastral maps.
* **Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB):** Produces hydrological and floodplain maps.
* **Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC):** Provides agricultural land and soil maps.
* **Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS):** Publishes statistical maps related to population, economy, and resources.
* **Department of Environment (DoE):** Prepares environmental and pollution-related maps.
* **Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD):** Produces weather and climate maps.
* **Urban Development Directorate (UDD):** Produces urban land use and planning maps.

A well-prepared map has several **features and characteristics** that make it readable and functional. These include:

1. **Title:** Indicates the subject or area covered by the map.
2. **Legend (Key):** Explains the symbols and colors used.
3. **Scale:** Shows the relationship between map distance and real-world distance.
4. **Compass or North Arrow:** Indicates direction.
5. **Grid/Coordinates:** Provides reference points for locating features.
6. **Border and Neatline:** Frame the map area.
7. **Projection:** Shows how the 3D Earth surface is represented on a flat map.
8. **Source and Date:** Give information about the map’s origin and currency.
9. **Symbols and Labels:** Represent physical or cultural features.

A good map should also have **accuracy, clarity, consistency, and simplicity** to ensure effective communication of spatial information.

![diagram](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSXy2nlks3SemcLir5ndwZiIkMw1_sGedBPyw&amp;s)

A **map projection** is a method of `transforming the curved surface of the Earth into a flat map`. Since the Earth is `roughly spherical`, no flat map can represent it perfectly without some distortion. Each projection balances accuracy in shape, area, distance, or direction depending on its purpose.

### Major Types of Map Projections

1. **Cylindrical Projection:**

   * The Earth is projected onto a cylinder.
   * Example: `Mercator` Projection—preserves direction but distorts area near the poles.

2. **Conical Projection:**

   * The Earth is projected onto a cone placed over part of the globe.
   * Example: `Lambert Conformal Conic` Projection—commonly used for `mid-latitude regions`.

3. **Azimuthal (Planar) Projection:**

   * The Earth is projected onto a `plane touching it at a single point`.
   * Example: *Polar Projection*—used for mapping polar regions.

### Projection Properties

Different projections preserve different properties:

* **Conformal:** Preserves `shape` (e.g., Mercator).
* **Equal-area:** Preserves `area` (e.g., Mollweide).
* **Equidistant:** Preserves distance from certain points.
* **Azimuthal:** Preserves `direction from a central point`.

The choice of projection depends on the **purpose and scale of the map**, ensuring minimal distortion for the intended use.
