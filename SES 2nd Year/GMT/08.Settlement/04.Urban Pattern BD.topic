**Ans:** In Bangladesh, urban settlement patterns can be classified into six types. They are described below:

### 1. Administrative Cities

* Administrative cities are those where the administrative activities of a region or the entire country are conducted.
* These cities often serve as the capital or regional centers of administration and politics.
* **Example:** Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh where all political and administrative activities are run. For this reason, Dhaka and its surrounding areas like Savar, Badda, and Bashundhara experience strong urbanization.

### 2. Defence Cities

* These cities originate due to military activities and installations.
* The presence of cantonments or military bases leads to the development of surrounding urban settlements.
* **Example:** The establishment of the Dhaka Cantonment led to the growth of urban settlements in its surrounding areas.

### 3. Cultural Cities

* Cultural cities are well known for cultural, religious, artistic, and educational activities.
* These cities attract people due to heritage sites, religious centers, or cultural institutions.
* **Example:** Sylhet is famous for the ornate tomb and mosque of Hazrat Shah Jalal. Depending on these religious and cultural activities, urbanization has developed in this region.

### 4. Commercialized / Market Cities

* In these cities, the economy revolves around the exchange, collection, and distribution of goods and services.
* Trade and commerce play the central role in shaping and expanding these settlements.
* **Example:** Narayanganj, Khulna, and Chattogram have developed as commercialized cities due to their business and trading importance.

### 5. Industrial Cities

* Industrial cities develop mainly due to the growth of industries, factories, and manufacturing activities.
* These cities attract laborers and entrepreneurs, leading to rapid urbanization.
* **Example:** Gazipur, Tongi, and Narayanganj are prominent industrial cities in Bangladesh.

### 6. Transport Cities

* These cities grow around major transport hubs such as ports, railway junctions, and highways.
* Their development depends on trade and movement of people and goods.
* **Example:** Chattogram has developed as a transport city due to its port facilities, while Jessore and Saidpur have grown around major transport and communication links.
