* Rural settlements are chiefly engaged in   `primary economic activities` such as agriculture, fishing, mining, and forestry.
* They are generally `small in size` and **sparsely populated**.
* Most rural settlements in Bangladesh are `unplanned`, often appearing as **nucleated**, **dispersed** (especially in hilly areas), or sometimes **linear** in pattern.
* The majority of rural people are `poor farmers`, who live close to their agricultural land and struggle against frequent natural calamities.
* Rural settlements have `limited social amenities`, and the lifestyle of the people is **simple and quiet**.
* The communities are often `close-knit`, with people speaking the `same language` and knowing each other well.
* Roads in rural areas are mostly `undeveloped`, and opportunities for **skill development with modern technology** are limited.
