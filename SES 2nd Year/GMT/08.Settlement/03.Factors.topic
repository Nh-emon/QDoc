Human settlement does not occur randomly; it is shaped by a combination of **physical** and **human (cultural, social, economic, political)** factors. These factors determine where people choose to live, how they build their settlements, and how those settlements grow over time.

### Physical Factors{.text-center}

#### a. Water Supply

* Access to rivers, lakes, and groundwater strongly influences settlement.
* Most ancient civilizations (e.g., Nile, Indus, Tigris-Euphrates) flourished near rivers.

#### b. Relief (Topography)

* Flat plains and gentle slopes are preferred for farming, transport, and construction.
* Mountains and deserts often limit settlement due to harsh conditions.

#### c. Climate

* Areas with moderate climate (not too hot or cold, with sufficient rainfall) attract large populations.
* Harsh climates like deserts, tundra, or high mountains have sparse settlements.

#### d. Soil Fertility

* Fertile alluvial plains (e.g., Ganges, Nile, Mississippi) support dense agricultural settlements.
* Poor soils in deserts or rocky areas discourage habitation.

#### e. Natural Resources

* Settlements often grow near mineral resources, forests, or fishing grounds for economic opportunities.
* Example: Coalfields in Ruhr (Germany) led to industrial towns.

### Human and Cultural Factors{.text-center}

#### a. Agricultural Development

* Farming opportunities attract permanent rural settlements.
* Irrigation-based agriculture sustains large populations in dry regions.

#### b. Industrialization and Employment

* Industrial growth creates urban settlements with varied job opportunities.
* Example: Industrial towns like Manchester and Detroit.

#### c. Transport and Trade Routes

* Settlements grow along roads, railways, ports, and rivers due to accessibility.
* Example: Singapore and Rotterdam as major port cities.

#### d. Political and Administrative Importance

* Capitals and administrative centers attract dense settlements.
* Example: Washington D.C., New Delhi, and Bras√≠lia.

#### e. Historical and Religious Factors

* Places of religious or historical significance develop into major settlements.
* Example: Mecca, Varanasi, Jerusalem.

#### f. Defense and Strategic Location

* Some settlements grew due to military or strategic importance.
* Example: Fortified cities like Jaipur and Cairo.

### 3. Modern Factors

* **Technology**: Availability of electricity, internet, and modern services supports urban expansion.
* **Migration**: Movement of people from rural to urban areas for jobs and education changes settlement distribution.
* **Globalization**: Cities connected to global markets (like New York, London, Tokyo) expand rapidly.
