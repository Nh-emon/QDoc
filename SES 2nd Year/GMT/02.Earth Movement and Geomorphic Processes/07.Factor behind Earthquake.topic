Earthquakes are caused mainly by the sudden release of energy in the Earth’s crust, leading to seismic waves. The major factors behind earthquakes include:

1. **Tectonic Plate Movements**

   * The Earth’s lithosphere is divided into plates that constantly move.
   * Collisions, subduction, divergence, and sliding of these plates generate stress, which is released as earthquakes.
   * Example: Himalayan earthquakes due to the collision of the Indian Plate and Eurasian Plate.

2. **Volcanic Activity**

   * Movement of magma and pressure buildup beneath volcanoes can fracture rocks, causing volcanic earthquakes.
   * Example: Earthquakes in volcanic zones like Japan or Indonesia.

3. **Faulting and Fractures in the Crust**

   * Sudden slips along geological faults release energy and cause earthquakes.
   * Example: San Andreas Fault in California.

4. **Isostatic Adjustment**

   * Uplift or subsidence of the Earth’s crust due to melting glaciers, erosion, or sediment loading can trigger earthquakes.

5. **Human-Induced (Anthropogenic) Activities**

   * Large-scale mining, deep drilling, construction of dams (reservoir-induced seismicity), and underground nuclear tests can cause artificial earthquakes.
   * Example: Koyna Dam region in India.

6. **Other Natural Causes**

   * Landslides or sudden collapse of large caves in limestone regions may generate minor local earthquakes.
