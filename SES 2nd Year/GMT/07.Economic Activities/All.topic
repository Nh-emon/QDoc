<sn><md>## Primary Activities{.text-center}

&gt; Primary activities are economic activities that directly depend on `natural resources`. 

They involve the extraction and collection of natural products from the Earth, such as soil, water, forests, and minerals. These are the most basic forms of production and form the foundation of all other economic activities.

1. `Nature-based` : They rely directly on natural resources like land, water, forests, and minerals.
2. `Oldest Activities` : These are the earliest human economic activities (e.g., hunting, gathering, farming).
3. `Labor Intensive` : They require more human effort than advanced machinery, especially in traditional economies.
4. `Seasonal Influence` : Output often depends on seasons and climatic conditions (e.g., crop harvest).
5. `Foundation of Other Sectors` : They supply raw materials to secondary industries.
6. `Rural Dominance` : Most primary activities are concentrated in rural areas.
7. `Examples Worldwide` : Agriculture in India, fishing in Japan, mining in South Africa, forestry in Canada.

&gt; Secondary activities are economic activities that involve the `processing, manufacturing, and transformation of raw materials` obtained from primary activities into finished or semi-finished products.

They add value to raw materials and create goods that are usable by consumers or can be further processed.

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
1. `Value Addition:` They convert raw materials into useful products.

   * Example: Cotton → Cloth, Iron ore → Steel.

2. `Industrial Base:` They form the industrial sector of an economy.

   * Example: Textile mills in Bangladesh, Steel plants in India.

6. `Link with Primary Sector:` Depend on raw materials from agriculture, mining, or forestry.

   * Example: Sugarcane → Sugar industry, Timber → Furniture industry.

7. `Influence on Economy:` Promote industrialization, urban growth, and modernization.

   * Example: Industrial Revolution in Europe transformed economies.

</md></sn><sn><md>## Tertiary Activities{.text-center}

&gt; Tertiary activities are economic activities that `provide services` instead of goods. 

They support the primary and secondary sectors by facilitating trade, distribution, and communication, and they directly serve people’s everyday needs.
