To describe atmospheric pressure, the National Weather Service uses a measure called the millibar (mb)</p><p>At sea level, the average pressure is slightly more than 1000 millibars. This corresponds to a weight of about 14.7 pounds per square inch</p><p>- Atmospheric pressure is simply the weight of the air above.</p><p>- The pressure at higher altitudes is less because there is less air.</p><p>The rate of pressure decrease with altitude is not constant—it drops rapidly near Earth's surface and more slowly at higher altitudes. Most atmospheric gases are concentrated near the surface and gradually thin out into space.</p><im>https://i.imgur.com/RLchddT.png</im><p>About half of the atmosphere lies below 5.6 km, and 90% is below 16 km. At 100 km, the air is thinner than the best vacuum at Earth's surface, yet the atmosphere extends thousands of kilometers into space. There’s no clear boundary between the atmosphere and space. Pressure decreases with altitude at a decreasing rate because air is highly compressible—expanding as pressure drops and compressing as it(pressure) rises.</p><ul><li>🌳 lower altitude = higher Air Molecule = higher dense/mass of air = higher Pressure = compressed air</li><li>🛰️ higher altitude = less air molecule = less Dense/Mass or air = less Pressure = expanded air</li></ul></sn><sn class="p-lg-5"><h2>Temperature Changes</h2><p>By the early 1900s, scientists observed that air temperature generally decreases with altitude, as seen on mountains. In 1902, Leon Teisserenc de Bort discovered that this decrease stops around 8–12 km, where temperature levels off. Further balloon and rocket studies revealed the atmosphere’s layered temperature structure, leading to its division into four main layers.</p><p>- Earth’s atmosphere is traditionally divided into four layers, based on temperature.</p><im>https://i.imgur.com/ZWB94b6.png</im><tb class="py-2"><pre>| <strong>Altitude Range (km)</strong> | <strong>Temperature Range (°C)</strong> | <strong>Layer Name</strong> | <strong>Key Characteristics</strong> |
| ---  | ---  | ---  | --- |
| 0 – 12 | 15 to -60 | Troposphere | Weather occurs, temperature decreases with altitude. Contains ~75% of the atmosphere. |
| 12 – 50 | -60 to 0 | Stratosphere | Contains the ozone layer; temperature increases due to UV absorption. |
| 50 – 80 | 0 to -100 | Mesosphere | Coldest layer; meteors burn up here. Temperature decreases with altitude. |
| 80 – 700+ | -100 to 1500+ | Thermosphere | Temperature rises sharply due to solar radiation. ISS orbits here. |
| &gt; 700 | Varies (near vacuum) | Exosphere | Merges with space; very few molecules. Satellites and auroras occur in lower parts. |

<li><strong>Troposphere</strong> – Closest to Earth, where life and weather exist.</li>
<li><strong>Stratosphere</strong> – Stable, dry layer; jets often fly here.</li>
<li><strong>Mesosphere</strong> – Protects Earth from meteoroids.</li>
<li><strong>Thermosphere</strong> – Absorbs high-energy X-rays and UV.</li>
<li><strong>Exosphere</strong> – Transition to outer space.</li>
