### Introduction{.text-center .fg-red}

Statistics is essential in understanding natural systems like soil, water, and the environment. It helps manage ==variability==, ==analyze complex interactions==, and support ==data-driven decisions== in research and policy.

### Applications of Statistics in Soil Research{.text-center .fg-teal}

| **Purpose**                | **Statistical Role**                                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Soil Sampling              | Use of sampling designs (random, stratified, systematic) for representative data  |
| Analyzing Soil Variability | Descriptive stats (mean, SD, range) and geostatistics (kriging, interpolation)    |
| Modeling &amp; Prediction      | Regression, correlation, machine learning for predicting soil responses           |
| Land Use Decision          | ANOVA, significance testing, and multivariate analysis to assess soil suitability |

### Applications of Statistics in Water Research{.text-center .fg-purple}

| **Purpose**                   | **Statistical Role**                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydrological Modeling         | Time series analysis for rainfall, runoff, drought, and streamflow patterns               |
| Water Quality Assessment      | Use of PCA, factor analysis, and clustering to identify pollution sources and water types |
| Risk and Uncertainty Analysis | Probability models for flood forecasting, water scarcity, and contamination risk          |
| Monitoring Program Design     | Statistical sampling to reduce cost and improve monitoring efficiency                     |

### Applications of Statistics in Environmental Research{.text-center .fg-orange}

| **Purpose**                    | **Statistical Role**                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyzing Environmental Change | Trend analysis for climate change, temperature rise, biodiversity decline              |
| Pollution Monitoring           | Use of inferential statistics to detect anomalies and pollution events                 |
| Impact Assessment              | Pre- and post-intervention comparisons in EIAs using t-tests, ANOVA, regression        |
| Ecological Studies             | Analysis of biodiversity, species abundance, and distribution using ecological indices |
