### What is Statistics?

Statistics is the ==science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data==. It provides ==tools and methods== for making sense of numerical information and helps us make decisions based on data, whether in science, business, economics, medicine, or everyday life.

At its core, statistics deals with **variability** and **uncertainty**, helping researchers and analysts draw conclusions about ==populations based on limited observations (samples)==.

<sn><md>### Types of Statistics{.fg-green .text-center}

| **Type**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Summarizes and describes the main features of a dataset using numbers, tables, and graphs. E.g., mean, median, mode, standard deviation.   |
| **Inferential Statistics** | Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. E.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis. |</md></sn><sn><md>### Key Concepts in Statistics{.text-center .fg-indigo}

| **Concept**            | **Explanation**                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Population**         | The entire group about which information is desired (e.g., all students in a school). |
| **Sample**             | A subset of the population used for analysis (e.g., 100 students from the school).    |
| **Variable**           | A characteristic or attribute that can vary (e.g., height, age, test score).          |
| **Mean (Average)**     | Sum of values divided by the number of values.                                        |
| **Median**             | The middle value when data is arranged in order.                                      |
| **Mode**               | The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.                                  |
| **Standard Deviation** | A measure of how spread out the values are from the mean.                             |
| **Probability**        | The likelihood or chance that a particular event will occur.                          |</md></sn><sn><md>### Importance of Statistics{.text-center .fg-orange}

Whether in scientific discovery, economic planning, or everyday life, statistical thinking helps us see patterns, test ideas, and find evidence-based answers. As data continues to grow in size and importance, so too does the value of statistical literacy in the modern world.</span></div><p></p></sn>
