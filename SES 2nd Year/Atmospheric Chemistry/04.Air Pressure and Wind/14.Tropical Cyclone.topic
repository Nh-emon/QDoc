A **Tropical Cyclone** is a powerful, rotating storm system that forms over warm tropical and subtropical oceans. It is characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and a well-defined low-pressure center known as the **eye**. Depending on the region, tropical cyclones are also called **hurricanes** (Atlantic and Eastern Pacific), **typhoons** (Western Pacific), and **cyclones** (Indian Ocean and South Pacific).

### Conditions for Formation

Tropical cyclones require specific conditions to develop:

1. **Warm Ocean Water:** Sea surface temperature above **26.5°C** provides energy.
2. **High Humidity:** Moist air in the lower and middle troposphere.
3. **Coriolis Force:** Needed to initiate rotation (cyclones do not form near the equator).
4. **Low Wind Shear:** Minimal change in wind speed and direction with height to maintain structure.
5. **Pre-existing Disturbance:** Such as a tropical wave or low-pressure zone.

### Structure of a Tropical Cyclone

1. **Eye:** Calm, clear, low-pressure center with light winds.
2. **Eyewall:** Surrounding the eye, this zone has the **strongest winds and heaviest rainfall**.
3. **Rainbands:** Curved bands of clouds and rain spiraling outward from the center.
4. **Outflow:** Upper-level winds spreading away from the storm, allowing further growth.

### Stages of Development

1. **Tropical Disturbance:** Cluster of thunderstorms forms over warm waters.
2. **Tropical Depression:** Organized system with wind speeds up to **61 km/h**.
3. **Tropical Storm:** Winds between **62–118 km/h**, system receives a name.
4. **Tropical Cyclone (Hurricane/Typhoon):** Winds exceed **118 km/h**, storm becomes severe.

### Impacts of Tropical Cyclones

* **Strong Winds:** Cause destruction of infrastructure, trees, and power lines.
* **Storm Surge:** Abnormal rise of seawater leading to coastal flooding.
* **Heavy Rainfall &amp; Flooding:** Can trigger landslides and damage crops.
* **Economic Losses:** Destruction of property, agriculture, and disruption of trade.
* **Human Losses:** Death, displacement, and health hazards.

---

### Distribution

* **North Atlantic &amp; Eastern Pacific:** Hurricanes.
* **Western Pacific:** Typhoons (most intense storms).
* **Indian Ocean &amp; South Pacific:** Cyclones.

### Conclusion

Tropical cyclones are among the **most destructive natural hazards**, fueled by the energy of warm oceans. With climate change and rising sea temperatures, their **frequency and intensity are expected to increase**, making preparedness and early warning systems crucial for reducing their devastating impacts.
