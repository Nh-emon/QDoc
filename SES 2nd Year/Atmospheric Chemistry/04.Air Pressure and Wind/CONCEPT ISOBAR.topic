&gt; An **isobar** is a **line drawn** on a weather map that `connects all points having the same atmospheric pressure` at a given time, usually reduced to sea level.

The word “isobar” comes from the Greek words *iso* (equal) and *baros* (weight or pressure). Isobars help meteorologists and geographers understand and predict atmospheric conditions by showing pressure distribution across large areas.

<sn><md>### Characteristics of Isobars{.text-center}

* Every point on a given isobar has the ++same atmospheric pressure++.
*  **Closed Curves**: Isobars usually form closed loops around high or low pressure centers.
* **No Crossing**: Isobars never intersect each other since a location cannot have two different pressures at the same time.
* **Relation with Wind**: Wind generally flows nearly ++parallel to isobars++ due to the Coriolis force, but slightly across them toward low pressure due to friction.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Isobars and Pressure Gradient Force{.text-center}

The **pressure gradient force (PGF)** arises due to differences in pressure across horizontal distances.

* If two isobars are **close together**, the PGF is stronger, leading to high wind speeds.
* If two isobars are **far apart**, the PGF is weaker, producing gentle winds.

Mathematically, the PGF is expressed as:

$$
PGF = -\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta n}
$$



+++ Where:

* $\rho$ = air density
* $\Delta P$ = pressure difference
* $\Delta n$ = distance between isobars

1. **High Pressure (Anticyclone)**: Isobars form roughly circular, `outward-spreading loops`. Winds move outward and clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.
2. **Low Pressure (Cyclone)**: Isobars form `inward-closing loops`. Winds move inward and counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.
3. **Troughs and Ridges**: Elongated low-pressure and high-pressure zones represented by curved isobar lines.
