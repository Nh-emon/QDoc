&gt; The rate of change of pressure over distance is called **pressure gradient force**.
* Due to `unequal heating` of the earth's surface a temperature gradient occurs on the earth's Surface.
* When temperature gradient occurs in an area `air moves vertically` from the warmer location as its density falls down.
* As a result, `surrounding air moves horizontally` from high pressure area in response to pressure gradient (0.e., to balance the pressure qap/ pressure difference).
* Air moves forming winds wherever there is a pressure gradient. The greater the `difference between the high pressure and low pressure` areas is, `the higher the wind speed`.
