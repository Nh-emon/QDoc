Land and sea breezes are **local winds** that occur due to the **unequal heating and cooling of land and sea**. These winds are most common in **coastal regions** and usually happen on a **daily cycle**.

### Daytime ‚òÄÔ∏è{.text-center}
1. **During the day**, land heats up faster than the sea.
2. The **air above the land** becomes warmer, lighter, and rises, creating a **low-pressure zone**.
3. The **air over the sea** remains cooler and denser, creating a **high-pressure zone**.
4. The cool air from the sea flows toward the land to replace the rising warm air ‚Üí this is called the **sea breeze**.

### Nighttime üåô{.text-center}
1. **At night**, land cools down faster than the sea.
2. The **air above the land** becomes cooler and denser, creating a **high-pressure zone**.
3. The **air over the sea** remains relatively warmer, creating a **low-pressure zone**.
4. The cooler air from the land flows toward the sea to replace the rising warm air ‚Üí this is called the **land breeze**.

#### Valley Breeze‚òÄ{.text-center}

* During the day, the **sun heats the mountain slopes** more quickly than the valley floor.
* The warm air on the slopes becomes **lighter and rises upward**.
* This rising air creates a **low-pressure area on the slopes**, and cooler air from the valley moves upward to replace it.
* This upslope movement of air is called the **Valley Breeze**.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
#### Mountain Breezeüåô {.text-center}

* At night, the **mountain slopes cool down quickly** compared to the valley floor.
* The cooler, denser air on the slopes **sinks downward** into the valley.
* This creates a **down-slope flow of air**, known as the **Mountain Breeze**.

</md></sn><sn><md>## What is Monsoon?

Monsoon is a ++seasonal reversal of winds++ that brings distinct `wet and dry seasons`, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The word *monsoon* comes from the Arabic word *‚Äúmausim‚Äù*, meaning **season**.

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
### Key Features of Monsoon{.text-center}

* **Seasonal Winds:** Winds change direction with the seasons.
* **Summer Monsoon:** Moist oceanic winds blow from sea to land, causing heavy rainfall.
* **Winter Monsoon:** Dry continental winds blow from land to sea, causing dry weather.
* **Driven by Heating Contrast:** Caused mainly by the ++differential heating of land and sea++ and the ++shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)++.

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
### Examples of Monsoon Regions{.text-center}

* **South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka)**
* **Southeast Asia (Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Philippines)**
* **Parts of Africa (West Africa, East Africa)**
* **Northern Australia**

#### What is ITCZ?

The **Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)** is a **low-pressure belt** near the equator where the **northeast and southeast trade winds converge**. This zone is marked by rising warm, moist air, cloud formation, and heavy rainfall.

### How ITCZ Controls Monsoon

1. **Summer (Southwest Monsoon)**

   * During summer, the landmass (like India and South Asia) heats up strongly.
   * The ITCZ shifts **northward** (around 20‚Äì25¬∞N).
   * This attracts the **moist southwest monsoon winds** from the Indian Ocean toward the land.
   * Result: Heavy rainfall across tropical and subtropical Asia.

2. **Winter (Northeast Monsoon)**

   * In winter, the land cools down, and high pressure develops over the continent.
   * The ITCZ shifts **southward** back toward the equator.
   * Winds reverse direction and blow from land to sea (northeast monsoon).
   * Result: Dry weather over most of Asia, though southeast India and Sri Lanka get rain.

### Key Point

The **north-south shifting of the ITCZ** with the **apparent movement of the sun** is the **main driver of monsoon winds**.

| Season | ITCZ Position                   | Wind Direction                             | Effect                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Summer | Shifts northward (20‚Äì25¬∞N)      | Moist winds from ocean ‚Üí land (SW Monsoon) | Heavy rainfall               |
| Winter | Shifts southward (near equator) | Dry winds from land ‚Üí ocean (NE Monsoon)   | Dry season (except SE India) |
