* &gt; **Definition**:Condensation is the process by which ++water vapor++ cools and `changes into` ++liquid water droplets++ or ++solid ice crystals++. 
* It occurs after air becomes `saturated`, either due to cooling or the addition of extra water vapor.
* **Latent Heat Release**
* During condensation, `latent heat is released` as the state changes from ++gas to liquid or solid++. This heat does not require an external energy source.
* **Favorable Conditions for Condensation**
Condensation is more likely when relative humidity is high. The following situations help lower air temperature and cause condensation:

1. **Surface/Contact Cooling** – Warm moist air passes over a cold land surface.
2. **Radiative Cooling** – Strong radiation on a clear winter night forms dew, hoar frost, or radiation fog in valleys.
3. **Mixing of Air Masses** – Different temperature air masses mix, become supersaturated, and condensation begins.
4. **Lifting and Adiabatic Cooling** – Warm moist air rises and cools dynamically (adiabatic process).

#### Condensation at or Near the Earth’s Surface{.text-center}
* When warm moist air cools to its dew-point temperature by `contact or radiative cooling`.
* Leads to the formation of **dew, fog, or frost**.
* These are mostly `non-adiabatic (diabatic)` processes, as heat is exchanged between the ++surface and the air++.
* Follows the `Second Law of Thermodynamics`: ++heat transfers from hot to cold++.

#### Condensation Aloft within the Troposphere{.text-center}
* Air masses are forced upward by `convection or mechanical` lifting.
* Rising air cools `adiabatically` until it reaches the dew-point temperature, leading to cloud formation.
* Follows the `First Law of Thermodynamics`: if no heat is added or removed, expansion does work on air molecules, lowering internal energy and cooling the air.
:::
**Aloft** : up in the air or at a higher level above the ground.
