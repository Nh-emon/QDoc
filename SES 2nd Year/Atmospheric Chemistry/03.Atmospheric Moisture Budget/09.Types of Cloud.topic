&gt; A **cloud** is a visible `mass of tiny water droplets or ice crystals` suspended in the atmosphere.

Clouds form when moist air rises, expands, and cools, causing water vapor to condense around small particles like dust, salt, or smoke. They play a vital role in Earthâ€™s weather and climate system by controlling precipitation, reflecting sunlight, and trapping heat.
