&gt; Precipitation is the process by which `water in various forms` (liquid or solid) `falls` from the atmosphere to the Earthâ€™s surface.

### Rain {.text-center}
* Liquid water droplets larger than **0.5 mm** in diameter.
* Formed when cloud droplets coalesce and fall when too heavy to remain suspended.
* Most common type of precipitation.

### Snow{.text-center}
* Ice crystals formed directly from water vapor in sub-freezing conditions.
* Combines into snowflakes with intricate crystalline structures.
* Falls when the entire atmospheric column is below freezing.

### Hail{.text-center}
* Hard, spherical pellets of ice.
* Formed in strong cumulonimbus clouds with intense updrafts.
* Layers of ice accumulate around nuclei before falling.

### Graupel (Soft Hail){.text-center}

* Fragile, soft pellets of rime-coated snowflakes.
* Formed when supercooled water droplets freeze onto snow crystals.
* Softer and more crumbly than hail.

### Sleet (Ice Pellets){.text-center}
* Frozen raindrops or refrozen partially melted snowflakes.
* Occurs when a layer of above-freezing air lies between two sub-freezing layers.
* Falls as small, transparent ice pellets.

### Dew{.text-center}

* Moisture condensed from water vapor directly onto surfaces (grass, leaves, soil).
* Occurs during clear, calm nights when surfaces cool below the **dew point**.
* Not a result of cloud processes, but a surface condensation phenomenon.

* White, feathery ice crystals deposited on surfaces.
* Formed by direct sublimation of water vapor onto objects below freezing.
* Common on cold, clear nights.

### Rime{.text-center}
![diagram](https://i.redd.it/dj7p7zq3s1ba1.jpg)
* Milky, opaque ice formed when supercooled fog or cloud droplets freeze instantly upon contact with surfaces.
* Usually occurs in foggy, freezing, and windy conditions.
