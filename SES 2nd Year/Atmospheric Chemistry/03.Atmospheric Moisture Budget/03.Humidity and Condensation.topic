Humidity is a fundamental concept in meteorology, climatology, and environmental science.It refers to `the amount of water vapor present in the air`. Water vapor, though invisible, plays a crucial role in weather patterns, cloud formation, and human comfort. Understanding humidity is essential for **agriculture, health, construction, and forecasting atmospheric conditions**.

Humidity is defined as the ==concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere==. {.bar} 

Unlike other gases such as oxygen or nitrogen, water vapor is `highly variable` and depends on factors such as ==temperature, pressure, and geographical location==.

:::.col-12 .col-lg-7

Absolute humidity is the ==actual mass of water vapor present in a unit volume of air==. {.bar}

It is expressed in grams of water vapor per cubic meter of air (`g/mÂ³`).

* Formula:

  $$
  AH = \frac{\text{Mass of water vapor}}{\text{Volume of air}}
  $$

* Limitation: It changes with variations in air `volume` and `temperature`, making it less useful for practical meteorological purposes.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Relative Humidity{.fg-red .text-center}

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-7
Relative humidity is the **ratio of** the `actual water vapor content in the air` to the ==maximum amount the air can hold== at a given temperature, expressed as a percentage. {.bar}

* Example: If the RH is `70%`, it means the **air contains `70%` of the maximum water vapor** it could hold at that temperature.
* Importance: RH is the most commonly used measure because it directly **relates to human comfort and weather conditions**.

### Formula{.fg-orange}

  $$
  RH = \frac{\text{Actual Vapor Pressure}}{\text{Saturation Vapor Pressure}} \times 100
  $$
</md></sn><sn><md>### Specific Humidity{.fg-red}

Specific humidity refers to the **ratio of** the `mass of water vapor to the total mass of air` (including ==dry air and water vapor==). It is expressed in grams of water vapor per kilogram of air. Unlike relative humidity, it is *not affected by temperature changes*.

### 4. Mixing Ratio{.fg-pink}

The *mixing ratio* is the `mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air`, usually expressed in grams of water vapor per kilogram of dry air.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Factors Affecting Humidity{.fg-red .text-center}

1. `Temperature`: Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, making tropical regions more humid.
2. `Geographical Location`: Coastal areas generally have higher humidity than inland regions.
3. `Air Movement`: Winds can transport moist or dry air, influencing local humidity levels.
4. `Evaporation and Transpiration`: Water bodies, soil evaporation, and plant transpiration add water vapor to the atmosphere.
5. `Altitude`: Higher altitudes usually have lower humidity due to lower temperatures and reduced air pressure.
