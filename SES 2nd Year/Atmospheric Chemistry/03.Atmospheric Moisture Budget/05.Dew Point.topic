The **dew point** is the **temperature** at which `air becomes saturated with water vapor` and condensation begins. In simpler terms, it is the temperature to which the air must be cooled (at constant pressure and moisture content) for water vapor to condense into liquid water droplets (dew).

### Key Points

* When air temperature = dew point → air is fully saturated (relative humidity = 100%).
* If the air cools below the dew point → condensation occurs (dew, fog, clouds).
* A ++higher dew point++ means more `moisture` in the air, while a ++lower dew++ point indicates `drier air`.

### Importance

* Used to measure **humidity and comfort level** (higher dew point → more humid and uncomfortable).
* Crucial in **weather forecasting** for predicting dew, fog, frost, and cloud formation.
* Important in **aviation, agriculture, and HVAC systems** to monitor air moisture conditions.

### Comfort Levels by Dew Point

| Dew Point (°C) | Comfort Level               |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| &lt; 10°C         | Dry, comfortable air        |
| 10–16°C        | Pleasant, slightly humid    |
| 16–20°C        | Humid, noticeable moisture  |
| 20–24°C        | Very humid, uncomfortable   |
| &gt; 24°C         | Oppressive, extremely humid |</md></sn>
