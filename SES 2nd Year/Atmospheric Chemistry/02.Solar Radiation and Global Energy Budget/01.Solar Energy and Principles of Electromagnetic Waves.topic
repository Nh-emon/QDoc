Electromagnetic radiation travels in the form of **waves**, and its behavior is described by several key properties.

:::.row

#### **Wavelength (Œª)** {.text-center}

* The distance between two consecutive wave crests or troughs.
* Unit: **meter (m)**, often expressed in **nanometers (nm)** or **micrometers (¬µm)**.

#### **Amplitude (A)** {.text-center}

* The **height of the wave** from its mean position.
* Related to the **intensity (brightness)** of radiation.

</md></sn><sn><md>## Properties of the Solar Spectrum{.text-center}

The **solar spectrum** refers to the range of ++electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun++. Since the Sun behaves almost like a `blackbody radiator` at about **6000 K**, its spectrum spans from **ultraviolet (UV)** to **infrared (IR)**, with the peak in the **visible range**.

</md></sn><sn><md>## Principle of Electromagnetic Radiation{.text-center}

&gt; Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) refers to the energy transmitted through space in the form of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, which travel together as waves at the speed of light. 

It covers a wide spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.

### Core Principles {.text-center}

1. `Dual Nature (Wave-Particle Duality)`

   * Electromagnetic radiation behaves both like a wave (with wavelength and frequency) and like particles (photons carrying energy).

2. `Oscillating Fields`

   * EMR consists of **perpendicular oscillating electric and magnetic fields**.
   * These fields are also **perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation**.

3. `Speed of Propagation`

   * In a vacuum, electromagnetic radiation travels at the **speed of light (c ‚âà 3 √ó 10‚Å∏ m/s)**.
   * The relationship between speed, wavelength (Œª), and frequency (ŒΩ) is:

     $$
     c = ŒªŒΩ
     $$

4. `Energy of Photons`

   * Each photon carries energy proportional to its frequency:

     $$
     E = hŒΩ
     $$

     where *h* = Planck‚Äôs constant (6.626 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥‚Å¥ J¬∑s).

5. `Interaction with Matter`

   * EMR can be **absorbed, reflected, refracted, scattered, or transmitted** depending on the medium.
   * Higher-frequency radiation (like UV, X-rays, gamma rays) carries more energy and can ionize atoms.

6. `No Medium Required`

   * Unlike sound waves, EMR does **not require a material medium**; it can travel through the vacuum of space.

---

### Summary{.text-center}

The principle of electromagnetic radiation is that it is the transmission of energy through oscillating electric and magnetic fields, traveling at the speed of light, carrying energy as photons, and interacting with matter in diverse ways.

</md></sn><sn><md>## Electromagnetic Radiation and Fundamental Laws

Electromagnetic radiation, especially when emitted by a `blackbody`, follows some key physical laws that describe its intensity, distribution, and wavelength characteristics. Three important ones are **Planck‚Äôs Law, Wien‚Äôs Displacement Law, and Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann‚Äôs Law**.

---

### Planck‚Äôs Quantum Law (Energy‚ÄìFrequency Relation){.text-center}

* **Statement**: The energy of electromagnetic radiation is not continuous, but emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called **quanta (photons)**.
* The energy of each photon is **directly proportional to its frequency**:

$$
E \propto \nu
$$

$$
E = h\nu
$$

Where:

* $E$ = energy of one photon (J)
* $\nu$ = frequency of radiation (Hz)
* $h$ = Planck‚Äôs constant = $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, J¬∑s$

---

### Meaning

* Higher frequency radiation (like **X-rays, gamma rays**) has **more energetic photons**.
* Lower frequency radiation (like **radio waves**) has **less energetic photons**.
* This principle is the foundation of **quantum mechanics** and explains phenomena like the **photoelectric effect**.



### 2. Wien‚Äôs Displacement Law (Peak Wavelength){.text-center}

* **Principle**: The wavelength at which maximum emission occurs shifts with temperature.

* **Equation**:

  $$
  Œª_{max} = \frac{b}{T}
  $$

  Where:

  * $Œª_{max}$ = wavelength of maximum intensity (m)
  * $b$ = Wien‚Äôs constant = $2.897 √ó 10^{-3} \, \text{m¬∑K}$
  * $T$ = absolute temperature (K)

* **Meaning**:

  * Hotter objects emit radiation at **shorter wavelengths**.
  * Example: The Sun (\~6000 K) peaks in the **visible range**, while Earth (\~288 K) peaks in the **infrared range**.

---

### 3. Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann Law (Total Emission){.text-center}

* **Principle**: The total energy radiated per unit area of a blackbody across all wavelengths is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature.

* **Equation**:

  $$
  E = œÉT^4
  $$

  Where:

  * $E$ = total emissive power (W/m¬≤)
  * $œÉ$ = Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant = $5.67 √ó 10^{-8} \, W¬∑m^{-2}¬∑K^{-4}$
  * $T$ = absolute temperature (K)

* **Meaning**:

  * If temperature doubles, energy radiated increases by **16 times**.
  * Explains why hotter stars shine much brighter than cooler ones.

---

### Relationship Between the Three Laws{.text-end}

* **Planck‚Äôs Law** gives the **full distribution** of energy with wavelength.
* **Wien‚Äôs Law** is derived from Planck‚Äôs Law and tells us the **peak wavelength**.
* **Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann Law** is obtained by integrating Planck‚Äôs distribution over all wavelengths, giving the **total radiation** emitted.

Only a fraction of the mass of hydrogen is converted into helium; the lost mass is transformed into energy according to **Einstein‚Äôs equation, E = mc¬≤**.This is the source of all the Sun‚Äôs light and heat.

### Transport of Energy Inside the Sun

The energy created in the core must travel outward before it can escape into space:

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
1. **Radiative Zone**

   * Energy moves slowly through radiation.
   * Photons (packets of light energy) are absorbed and re-emitted by particles.
   * It can take **thousands to millions of years** for a photon to pass through this zone.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-lg-6
2. **Convective Zone**

   * Energy moves by convection currents.
   * Hot plasma rises toward the surface, cools, then sinks back down.
   * This creates a constant boiling-like motion within the Sun.
:::

</md></sn><sn><md>### Reactions at the Core{.text-center}

The Sun‚Äôs energy comes from **nuclear fusion**.

* **Process**: Hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium nuclei, releasing massive amounts of energy.
* **Main reaction chain**: The **proton-proton chain reaction**.

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-7
Steps of proton-proton chain:

1. Two protons fuse ‚Üí deuterium + positron + neutrino.
2. Deuterium fuses with another proton ‚Üí helium-3.
3. Two helium-3 nuclei combine ‚Üí helium-4 + 2 protons.

This reaction:

* Converts **hydrogen into helium**.
* Releases **light and heat energy**.
* Produces neutrinos that escape into space.

Every second, the Sun fuses about `600 million tons of hydrogen` into helium, releasing energy equivalent to **billions of hydrogen bombs**.

The Sun has several distinct layers, each with unique properties:

1. **Core**

   * Innermost region where `nuclear fusion occurs`.
   * Temperature: about `15 million ¬∞C`.
   * Source of the `Sun‚Äôs energy`.

2. **Radiative Zone**

   * Energy from the core moves outward mainly by `radiation`.
   * Photons may take ++thousands to millions++ of years to pass through.

3. **Convective Zone**

   * Energy is transported by convection currents (rising hot plasma and sinking cooler plasma).
   * Creates the granulated appearance of the Sun‚Äôs surface.

4. **Photosphere**

   * The `visible surface` of the Sun.
   * Temperature: about `5,500 ¬∞C`.
   * Appears as a bright disk with sunspots.

5. **Chromosphere**

   * Lies above the photosphere.
   * Appears reddish during solar eclipses.

6. **Corona**

   * `Outermost layer` extending millions of kilometers into space.
   * Visible during total solar eclipses as a `glowing halo`.

The Sun is made up *mostly of gases*, primarily:

* **Hydrogen (‚âà 74%)**
* **Helium (‚âà 24%)**
* **Other elements (‚âà 2%)**, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron in trace amounts.

This composition explains why the Sun is often referred to as a `giant ball of plasma`.

The Sun is the `central star` of our solar system and the primary `source of light and energy` that sustains life on Earth. It is a `massive sphere of hot plasma` held together by gravity and powered by nuclear fusion reactions at its core.

### Formation of the Sun

:::.row

:::.col-12 .col-lg-7
The Sun formed about `4.6 billion years ago` from a ++giant molecular cloud++ composed mostly of `hydrogen and helium`. Under the influence of *gravity*:

1. The cloud began to `collapse and spin`, forming a **protostar**.
2. As the material compressed, temperature and pressure increased in the core.
3. When the core reached around **10 million ¬∞C**, ++nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium began++.
4. This marked the birth of the Sun as a main-sequence star.
