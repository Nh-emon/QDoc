The **heat budget of the Earth** is the balance between the incoming solar radiation received from the Sun and the outgoing terrestrial radiation emitted back into space.

It represents the way energy is `absorbed`, `reflected`, `stored`, and `re-radiated` in the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans.

* When the ++incoming and outgoing energy are equal++, the Earth’s overall `temperature remains stable`.
* If there is an imbalance, it leads to warming (more energy absorbed) or cooling (more energy lost).

In short, the **Earth’s heat budget** is the energy balance system that regulates the planet’s climate and temperature.

#### Conduction

* Conduction is the transfer of heat energy through direct contact between molecules `without any movement` of the material as a whole.
* Heat flows from the hotter part of a substance to the colder part, mainly in solids (e.g., heating one end of a metal rod).

---

#### Convection

* Convection is the transfer of heat by the `actual movement` of fluid (liquid or gas) from one place to another.
* Warmer, lighter fluid rises while cooler, denser fluid sinks, creating a circulation pattern (e.g., boiling water, atmospheric circulation).

---

#### Radiation

* Radiation is the `transfer of heat energy in the form of electromagnetic waves`, without the need for any medium.
* Heat from the Sun reaches the Earth through radiation (e.g., feeling warmth from sunlight or a fire).

---

#### Advection

* Advection is the `horizontal transfer of heat energy` by the movement of air masses, especially wind.
* It differs from convection, which involves vertical movement.
* For example, warm air moving from the tropics to higher latitudes is advection.

&gt; Insolation is the amount of solar radiation energy received per unit area on Earth’s surface in a given time.

* It is usually measured in watts per square meter (W/m²) or calories/cm²/min.
* Insolation depends on factors like latitude, season, time of day, and atmospheric conditions.
* Roughly 1 part in 2 billion of the Sun’s total energy output actually falls on Earth.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Heat Budget{.text-center}

The Sun is the primary source of energy for Earth. The total solar energy reaching Earth is called **insolation**. Insolation is not evenly distributed across the globe due to the curvature of the Earth, the tilt of its axis, and the presence of clouds and aerosols.

&gt; Roughly 2 part in 1 billion of the Sun’s total energy output actually falls on Earth

</md></sn><sn><md>## Energy Balance{.text-center}

The heat budget of Earth is a dynamic equilibrium between incoming solar energy and outgoing terrestrial radiation:

1. **Incoming energy** = **Reflected energy + Absorbed energy**
2. **Absorbed energy** = **Energy emitted back into space**

When these are balanced, Earth maintains a relatively stable climate. Any imbalance can lead to global warming or cooling.

| Process | Amount |
| ------- | ------ |
| Reflect | 30%    |
| Absorb  | 70%    |
| Rediate | 70%    |

1. **Incoming energy (100%)** = **Reflected energy (30%) + Absorbed energy (70%)**
2. **Absorbed energy (70%)** = **Energy emitted back into space (70%)**
