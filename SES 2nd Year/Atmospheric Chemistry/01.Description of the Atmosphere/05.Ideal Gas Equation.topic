We can combine `Boyle's` , `Charles` and `Avogardo's` law to form a single master equation known as ideal gas equation.in order to describes the relationship among pressure,temperature,volume and number of moles of a gas.

$$ V \propto \frac{nT}{P} $$
$$ V = \frac{RnT}{P} $$
$$ PV = nRT $$

Where,`R` = proportionality constant or ==ideal gas constant==

* Ideal gas equation implies that **pressure,temperature,volume and number of moles** of a gas are completely `interdependant`.Therefore,`any change in one` of them will cause a `compensating change in one`,or the remainder
  * If, n and T are held fixed,we obtain `Boyle's Law` $ p \propto \frac{1}{V} $
  * If, n and P are held fixed,we obtain `Charle's Law`  $ V \propto T $
  * If, P and T are held fixed,we obtain `Avogardo's Law`  $ V \propto n $

* An idal gas is a `hypothetical gas` whose pressure-temperature-volume behaviour can be completely accounted by the idal gas equation.

* Although there is no such thing in nature as ideal gas,most gases under resonable low pressure and high temperature behave like ideal gas.

* Thus, we can sefely use idal gas equation to solve any gas problems in enviromental science.

* Since it is convenient to use density rather than volume in studying atmosphere,the ideal gas law equation can be rearranged as 

  $$ P = R \rho T $$

* Thus,at any given pressure an increase in temperature causes as decrease in density and vice-versa.

Using the classic `STP` definition (0Â°C = 273.15 K, $1\ \text{atm}$)

From the ideal gas law:

$$
R = \frac{PV}{nT}
$$

For one mole ($n=1$) at STP:

* $P = 1\ \text{atm}$
* $V = 22.414\ \text{L}$
* $T = 273.15\ \text{K}$

$$
R = \frac{1\ \text{atm} \times 22.414\ \text{L}}{1\ \text{mol} \times 273.15\ \text{K}}
= 0.08206\ \text{L atm K}^{-1}\text{ mol}^{-1}
$$

### Convert to SI units

$$
R = \frac{101325\ \text{Pa} \times 0.022414\ \text{m}^3}{1\ \text{mol} \times 273.15\ \text{K}}
= 8.31447\ \text{J K}^{-1}\text{ mol}^{-1}
$$

As, $1m^3 = 1000L $

* R = ( $R_d$ for dry air ) = 287.04 j/kg K
* R = ( $R_w$ for moist air ) = 461.5 j/kg K</md></sn>
