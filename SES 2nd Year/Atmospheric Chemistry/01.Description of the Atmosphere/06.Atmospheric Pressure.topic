* Air is highly ==compressible==
* Thus,`lower layers` of the atmosphere are much `denser` than those above.
* The density of atmosphere `ðŸ‘‡ decreases sharply` with `ðŸ‘† increasing altitudes` as consequence of the gas laws and gravity.
* The atmosphere pressure is the **weight** of the overlying `atmosphere per unit area`.
* Pressure is measured as a `force per unit area`.

<sn><md>## Barometer{.fg-red .text-center}

Atmospheric pressure readings are measured near sea level with a mercury `barometer` to eliminate the effect of land elevation.
