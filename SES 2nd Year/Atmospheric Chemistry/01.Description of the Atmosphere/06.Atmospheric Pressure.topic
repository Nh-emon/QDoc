* Air is highly ==compressible==
* Thus,`lower layers` of the atmosphere are much `denser` than those above.
* The density of atmosphere `ðŸ‘‡ decreases sharply` with `ðŸ‘† increasing altitudes` as consequence of the gas laws and gravity.
* The atmosphere pressure is the **weight** of the overlying `atmosphere per unit area`.
* Pressure is measured as a `force per unit area`.

Atmospheric pressure readings are measured near sea level with a mercury `barometer` to eliminate the effect of land elevation.

We all know that,

$$ P = \frac{F}{A} \quad \text{(eq1)} $$

force per unit area.

Now,$F = mg$ ,here m is the mass of the barometer upto 76cm.

$$ \rho = \frac{m}{v}  $$
$$ m = \rho v  $$

Now $F = mg$ or $F = \rho v$,substituting F in eq1

$$ P = \frac{\rho vg}{A} $$

$$ P = \frac{\rho Ahg}{A} $$

$$ P = \rho h g $$

$$ P = 13.6 \times 76 \times 980 $$

$$ P = 1.0136\times10^6 dynes/cm^2 $$

+++ where, 
* density of mercury at 0Â° $\rho = 13.6g/cm^3$
* value of gravity = 980 cm/s^2
* height of the column of mercury = 76cm

#### Formula

$$
P = \frac{F}{A}
$$


### Approximation using Earthâ€™s parameters

Instead of using $\rho$ and $h$, we can derive pressure from the **weight of the atmosphere per unit area**:

As $F = mg$ ,

$$
P = \frac{M_{\text{atm}} \, g}{A_{\oplus}}
$$

+++ where

* $M_{\text{atm}}$ = total mass of Earthâ€™s atmosphere â‰ˆ $5.15 \times 10^{18}\ \text{kg}$
* $g$ = 9.80665 m/sÂ²
* $A_{\oplus}$ = surface area of Earth = $4 \pi R^2$, with Earthâ€™s mean radius $R \approx 6.371 \times 10^6\ \text{m}$
+++

### Calculation

1. **Earthâ€™s surface area**

$$
A_{\oplus} = 4 \pi (6.371 \times 10^6)^2 \approx 5.10 \times 10^{14}\ \text{m}^2
$$

2. **Total weight of atmosphere**

$$
W = M_{\text{atm}} g = (5.15 \times 10^{18})(9.80665) \approx 5.05 \times 10^{19}\ \text{N}
$$

3. **Pressure**

$$
P = \frac{W}{A_{\oplus}} = \frac{5.05 \times 10^{19}}{5.10 \times 10^{14}}
\approx 9.91 \times 10^4\ \text{Pa}
$$

#### Result

$$
P \approx 1.01 \times 10^5\ \text{Pa} = 101\ \text{kPa} \approx 1\ \text{atm}
$$

At sea-level the mass of air on per `unit square meter` surface area is about `10000 kg` per square meter,that is ==1kg per square centimeter==.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Variation of Atmospheric Pressure

Atmospheric pressure is not constant everywhere; it varies due to several factors such as altitude, temperature, and water vapor content.

### 1. Variation by Altitude

* ++Atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing altitude++ $P \propto \frac{1}{h}$ .
* At sea level, pressure is highest because the `air column above is maximum`.
* As altitude increases, the thickness of the air column decreases, reducing the weight of air and hence pressure.
* For example, at the top of Mount Everest, air pressure is about one-third of sea-level pressure.

### 2. Variation by Temperature

* ++Warm air is lighter (less dense) than cold air++.
* When temperature increases, air expands and rises, causing pressure at the surface to fall.
* Conversely, when temperature decreases, air contracts and becomes denser, causing pressure at the surface to rise.
* This explains why equatorial regions (warmer) generally have low pressure and polar regions (colder) have high pressure.

### 3. Variation by Water Vapor Content

* `Water vapor is lighter than dry air`?
* When the amount of water vapor increases (high humidity), the air becomes less dense, lowering atmospheric pressure.
* Conversely, dry air (low humidity) is denser and exerts higher pressure.
* This is why tropical humid regions often have lower pressure than dry desert regions at the same altitude.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Variation of Atmospheric Pressure with Height (Derivation)

Weâ€™ll derive the isothermal barometric relation starting from hydrostatic balance and the ideal gas law.

### Step 1: Hydrostatic balance

The vertical force balance in a static atmosphere is

$$
\frac{dp}{dz} = -\rho g
$$

where $p$ is pressure, $\rho$ is density, $g$ is gravitational acceleration.

### Step 2: Ideal gas law (molar form)

Using the ideal gas law per unit volume:

$$
p = \rho \, R_\text{u}\,\frac{T}{M}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\rho = \frac{p\,M}{R_\text{u}\,T}
$$

where $R_\text{u}$ is the universal gas constant and $M$ is the mean molar mass of air (assumed constant).

### Step 3: Combine and separate variables

Substitute $\rho$ into the hydrostatic equation:

$$
\frac{dp}{dz} = -\frac{p\,M}{R_\text{u}\,T}\,g
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{1}{p}\,dp = -\frac{M g}{R_\text{u} T}\,dz
$$

Assume an isothermal layer so $T$ is constant with $z$, and take $g, M$ constant.

### Step 4: Integrate between two levels

Integrate from level 1 $(z_1,p_1)$ to level 2 $(z_2,p_2)$:

$$
\int_{p_1}^{p_2}\frac{1}{p}\,dp \;=\; -\frac{M g}{R_\text{u} T}\int_{z_1}^{z_2}dz
$$

$$
\ln\!\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) \;=\; -\frac{M g}{R_\text{u} T}\,(z_2 - z_1)
$$

Let $\Delta z = z_2 - z_1$. Then

$$
\Delta z \;=\; -\,\frac{R_\text{u} T}{M g}\,\ln\!\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)
\;=\; \frac{R_\text{u} T}{M g}\,\ln\!\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)
$$

This is the requested form (up to equivalent logarithm arguments). Since typically $p_1&gt;p_2$ when $z_2&gt;z_1$, $\ln(p_1/p_2)&gt;0$ and $\Delta z&gt;0$ as expected.

---

### Notes and common variants

* Defining the **scale height** $H = \dfrac{R_\text{u} T}{M g}$, we get $\Delta z = H \ln(p_1/p_2)$.
* Using the **specific gas constant** for air $R_d = R_\text{u}/M \approx 287\,\text{J kg}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$, the **hypsometric equation** is

  $$
  \Delta z = \frac{R_d\,\overline{T_v}}{g}\,\ln\!\left(\frac{p_1}{p_2}\right)
  $$

  where $\overline{T_v}$ is the layer-mean **virtual temperature** (allows for moisture and non-isothermal layers).
* Assumptions used here: hydrostatic equilibrium, ideal gas, constant $T$ (isothermal layer), constant $g$ and $M$.
