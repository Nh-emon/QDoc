Understanding its composition is essential to studying climate, weather, and the survival of living organisms. The composition is `not uniform everywhere`; it varies with `altitude, temperature, and location`. However, the lower layers of the atmosphere, where life exists, have a fairly stable and well-defined mixture of gases.

1. **Nitrogen (78%)**
   Nitrogen is the most `abundant gas` in the atmosphere. Although it is not directly used in respiration by humans and animals, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the atmosphere by `diluting oxygen and preventing rapid combustion`. Nitrogen also participates in the `nitrogen cycle`, which is vital for plant growth.

2. **Oxygen (21%)**
   Oxygen is the `second most abundant` gas. It is essential for `breathing`, `combustion`, and most `biological processes`. Animals and humans depend on oxygen for survival, while plants release it during photosynthesis.

3. **Argon (0.93%)**
   Argon is an `inert gas` that does not participate in chemical reactions under normal conditions. Though present in small amounts, it contributes to the `stability of the atmosphere`.

4. **Carbon Dioxide (0.04%)**
   Carbon dioxide is a `trace gas` but extremely important. Plants use it in photosynthesis to produce food, and it helps regulate Earth’s temperature by `trapping heat` in the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. Human activities such as `burning fossil fuels` have increased carbon dioxide levels, `leading to global warming`.

5. **Water Vapor (Variable 0–4%)**
   Water vapor is `not evenly distributed` in the atmosphere, but it is significant because it `influences weather and climate`. It `absorbs heat`, forms clouds, and produces precipitation.

6. **Other Trace Gases**
   Apart from the major gases, the atmosphere `contains tiny amounts of gases` like ==neon, helium, methane, ozone, hydrogen, and krypton==. Despite their small concentrations, many of these gases have major roles. For example, `ozone protects Earth` from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, while `methane` contributes to the ==greenhouse effect==.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Conclusion{.fg-red .text-center}

The composition of the atmosphere is finely tuned to support life on Earth. Even though ==nitrogen and oxygen dominate==, trace gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone play disproportionately significant roles. Human activities are disturbing this balance, leading to climate change and environmental challenges. Protecting the atmosphere is therefore critical for the sustainability of life and the health of our planet.</md></sn>
