The atmospheric composition is `not uniform everywhere`; it varies with ==ALT== `altitude,location and temperature`. However, the lower layers of the atmosphere, where life exists, have a fairly stable and well-defined mixture of gases.

- Air is a mechanical mixture of gases and aerosols.
- **Dry air** is mostly composed of `nitrogen and oxygen`.
- Nitrogen and oxygen are *mixed in constant proportions* up to about 85km altitude.

1. **Nitrogen (78%)**
   Nitrogen is the most `abundant gas` in the atmosphere. Although it is not directly used in respiration by humans and animals, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the atmosphere by `diluting oxygen and preventing rapid combustion`. Nitrogen also participates in the `nitrogen cycle`, which is vital for plant growth.

2. **Oxygen (21%)**
   Oxygen is the `second most abundant` gas. It is essential for `breathing`, `combustion`, and most `biological processes`. Animals and humans depend on oxygen for survival, while plants release it during photosynthesis.

3. **Argon (0.93%)**
   Argon is an `inert gas` that does not participate in chemical reactions under normal conditions. Though present in small amounts, it contributes to the `stability of the atmosphere`.

4. **Carbon Dioxide (0.04%)**
   Carbon dioxide is a `trace gas` but extremely important. Plants use it in photosynthesis to produce food, and it helps regulate Earth‚Äôs temperature by `trapping heat` in the atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. Human activities such as `burning fossil fuels` have increased carbon dioxide levels, `leading to global warming`.

5. **Water Vapor (Variable 0‚Äì4%)**
   Water vapor is `not evenly distributed` in the atmosphere, but it is significant because it `influences weather and climate`. It `absorbs heat`, forms clouds, and produces precipitation.

6. **Other Trace Gases**
   Apart from the major gases, the atmosphere `contains tiny amounts of gases` like ==neon, helium, methane, ozone, hydrogen, and krypton==. Despite their small concentrations, many of these gases have major roles. For example, `ozone protects Earth` from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, while `methane` contributes to the ==greenhouse effect==.
