Koppen climate classification is widely used `vegetation-based`,empirical climate was to devise formulas deveoped by German-Russian botanist-climatologist `Wladimir Koopen`.

The Köppen climate classification scheme divides climates into `five main climate groups`: A (tropical), B (arid), C (temperate), D (continental), and E (polar).The ==second letter indicates the seasonal precipitation type==, while the t==hird letter indicates the level of heat==.**Summers** are defined as the six-month period that is warmer either from `April to September` and/or `October to March`, while **winter** is the `six-month` period that is cooler

* The Köppen climate classification is the most widely used climate classification scheme.It was first published by German-Russian climatologist ==Wladimir Köppen== (1846–1940) in `1884`,with several later modifications by Köppen, notably in 1918 and 1936.Later, German climatologist Rudolf Geiger (1894–1981) introduced some changes to the classification system in 1954 and 1961, which is thus sometimes called the ==Köppen–Geiger climate classification==

* As Köppen designed the system based on his experience as a `botanist`, his main climate groups represent a classification by `vegetation type`. In addition to identifying climates, the system can be used to analyze ecosystem conditions and identify the main types of `vegetation within climates`. Due to its association with the plant life of a given region, the system is useful in **predicting future changes of plant life within that region**

The Köppen classification works like a ==3-letter code== where each letter tells us something about the climate.

| [**first letter**] | [**second letter**] | [**third letter**] |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
|  primary climate zone | 🌧️  seasonal precipitation     | 🔥 level of heat |

==Except B== if you go toward Polar from the Equator the temperature will decrease,and there is less vegetation.

| **Main Group** | **Code** | **Altitude/Latitude Zone** | **Temperature Characteristics** |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Polar          | E        | High latitude / high altitude (poles, mountain tops) | Warmest month &lt; 10 °C |
| Continental    | D        | Mid–high latitude, interior or higher altitude | Coldest month &lt; –3 °C; Warmest &gt; 10 °C |
| Temperate      | C        | Mid-latitude, low–moderate altitude | Coldest month –3 °C to 18 °C; Warmest &gt; 10 °C |
| Tropical       | A        | Low altitude, near equator | All months ≥ 18 °C |

</md></sn><sn></sn><sn><md>## Criticisms of Koppen's Climate Classification

Some of the weaknesses of Koppen's climatic classification are as under :

---


1. Climatic elements such as `air pressure, air masses , humidity` etc, are ignored despite their effective role in the characterization of climate.

2. `Mathematical calculations` using computers could offer more accurate results.

3. `Landforms` play a decisive role in the distribution. Landforms have not been included in the scheme of climatic classification.

4. `Direction of wind and distribution of water and land bodies` exercises climate influence on the climatic conditions. The inclusion of these factors would have improved the climate classification qualitatively.

5. Aspects of `climate change and occurrence of extreme events` deserve some space in the classification because of its increasing consequences.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Summary

1. Köppen’s classification is based on the **empirical relationship** between `climate and vegetation`.

2. The classification provides an efficient way to **describe climatic conditions** defined by `precipitation and temperature and their seasonality`.

3. Climatic conditions identified through Köppen’s scheme of classification are ++relevant both for plant as well as animal life++. Therefore, the Köppen’s scheme of classification is `significant ecologically also`.

4. The classification is widely used to `map long-term climate` and associated ecological conditions.

5. It is simple and easy to work out the type of climate if `alphabetical (letter) codes` are known.

6. If data on temperature, precipitation and seasonality is available, it is `easy to code` the climate type.

7. With the increasing incidence of extreme climate events, there has been an increasing interest in using the classification to identify changes in climate and potential changes in vegetation, animal and human life forms.

8. The most useful significance of Köppen’s climate classification is that it `helps to predict the dominant vegetation type` based on ++climatic data and vice versa++.

9. From different scientific reports it has been established that more than `5% `of all the land area worldwide had moved from `wetter and colder` classifications to `drier and hotter` classifications.
