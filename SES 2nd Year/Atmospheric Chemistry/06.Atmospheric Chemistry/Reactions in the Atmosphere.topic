**Acid-Base** reactions occur between acidic and basic species in the atmosphere.

### Acid

Atmosphere is normally at least `slightly acidic` because of the presence of a low level of `carbon dioxide` ( $CO_2$ ),that dissolved in atmosphere water droplets and dissociates slightly.

$$ CO_2(\text{g}) + H_2O \to CO_2(\text{aq}) $$
$$ CO_2(\text{aq}) + H_2O \to H^+ + HCO_3^- $$

Storngly acidic $HNO_3$ and $H_2SO_4$ are formed by the atmospheric oxidation of nitrogen oxides,$SO_2$ and $H_2S$ gases,respectively.


### Base

In the atmosphere `basic` species are relatively `less common`.

Some `base` materials such as particulate ==calcium oxide,hydroxide and carbonate== get into the atmosphere from ==ash and ground rock==,that can react with acids to form bases,such as in the following reaction

$$ Ca(OH)_2(\text{s}) + H_2SO_4(\text{aq}) \to CaSO_4(\text{s}) + 2H_2O $$


### $NH_3$

Gas-phase ammonia ( $NH_3$ ) is an important source of base in the atmosphere,becuase it is the ==only water soluble base== presents at significant levels in the atmosphere.

Atmospheric ammonia ( $NH_3$ ) is formed from the ==biodegradation of nitrogen== containing biological matter and from bacterial reduction of nitrate.

$$ NO_3^-(\text{aq}) + 2{CH_2O}(\text{biomass}) + H^+ \to NH_3(\text{g}) + 2CO_2 + H_2O $$

When  ammonia ( $NH_3$ ) dissolves in atmospheric water droplets,plays a strong role in ==neutralizing atmospheric acids== as follows :

$$ NH_3(\text{aq}) + HNO_3(\text{aq}) \to NH_4NO_3(\text{aq}) $$
$$ NH_3(\text{aq}) + H_2SO_4(\text{aq}) \to NH_4HSO_4(\text{aq}) $$

<sn><md>## Atmospheric Nitrogen

A significant amount of $N_2$ is `fixed` in the atmoshpere by ==lightning process== (provides high energy to dissociate stable $N_2$ molecule)

Nitrogen is ==not readily dissociated by UV== in the **thermosphere** like oxygen,but at altitude ==above 100km==,atmoic nitrogen is produced by the photochemical reactions

$$ N_2 + h\nu \to N + N $$

In the troposphere ==oxides of nitrogen==(pollutant) like $NO_2$ **readily dissociate** photochemically into `NO` and reactive `atmoic oxygen`.

$$ NO_2 + h\nu \to NO + O $$

It is a significant photochemical process involved in the ==photochemical smog formation==.</md></sn><sn><md>## Atmospheric Water

Water vapor absorbs ==infrared (IR) radiation== strongly and thus,influences the earths heat balance.

Under certain circumstances,atmosphere water vapor influences the ==formation of pollution-induce fog== and also participates in different chemical process.

In **stratosphere**,the main `source of water vapor` is from the ==photochemical oxidation of methane==

$$ CH_4 + 2O_2 + h\nu \to CO_2 + 2H_2O $$

Thus,the water produced in stratorsphere serves as a ==source of hydroxyl radical== ($H\mathrm{O\cdot}$)

$$ H_2O + hv \to H\mathrm{O\cdot} + H $$</md></sn>
