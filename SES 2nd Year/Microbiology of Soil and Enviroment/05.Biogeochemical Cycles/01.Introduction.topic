- Biogeochemical cycles are critical to the existence of life, `transforming energy and matter into usable forms` to support the functioning of ecosystems.

- These cycles describe the `movement of matter` between the major reservoirs of Earth—the atmosphere, the terrestrial biosphere, the oceans or hydrosphere, and the geosphere (soil, sediments, and rocks).

- The `six` most common elements comprising organic molecules—the backbone of lifeforms—are carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.

- These elements reside in the different reservoirs to different extents and consist of a variety of chemical forms both organic and inorganic.

- The elements are not `lost` but are instead `recycled or accumulated` in reservoirs (or “sinks”) where they can be held for a long period of time.

- Microorganisms play a primary role in `regulating biogeochemical systems` in virtually all of our planet’s environments.

- The key collective `metabolic processes of microbes` (including nitrogen fixation, carbon fixation, methane metabolism, and sulfur metabolism) effectively control global biogeochemical cycling.

- Microbes comprise the backbone of every ecological system, particularly those in which there is `no light` (i.e. systems in which energy cannot be collected through photosynthesis ).</md></sn><config style="display:none"><tags>#01.introduction</tags><thumbnail></thumbnail><heading></heading><udate>Sun Jul 06 2025 08:11:22 GMT+0600 (Bangladesh Standard Time)</udate><id>article-Rdj8lYE6Xr</id><duration></duration></config>
