![images](https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Nitrogen-Cycle-Diagram.jpg)

* Nitrogen is the key component of `essential biomolecules` like amino acids, proteins, vitamins, enzymes, and hormones.
* The `nitrogen cycle` is the continuous process of circulation and exchange of nitrogen (N₂) between the atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and living organisms.
* The ultimate source of N₂ to all living organisms is atmospheric nitrogen, which constitutes about `78%` of the air.
* The steps of the nitrogen cycle are:

  1. `Nitrogen Fixation`
  2. `Nitrogen Assimilation`
  3. `Ammonification`
  4. `Nitrification`
  5. `Denitrification`
  6. `Sedimentation`

**Definition:**
`Nitrogen fixation` is the process of converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia or other usable nitrogenous compounds.

There are two types of nitrogen fixation processes:

### (i) Physico-Chemical Nitrogen Fixation

* Atmospheric nitrogen combines with oxygen during `thunderstorms, lightning, or electrical discharges` in the clouds and produces a series of nitrogen oxides:

  * N₂ + 2(O) → 2NO
  * 2NO + 2(O) → 2NO₂
  * 2NO₂ + (O) → N₂O₅
* These nitrogen oxides dissolve in rainwater and form `nitric acid`, which reaches the ground and reacts with various `mineral compounds` to form nitrates and other compounds:

  * N₂O₅ + H₂O → 2HNO₃
  * 2HNO₃ + CaCO₃ → Ca(NO₃)₂ + CO₂ + H₂O

### (ii) Biological Nitrogen Fixation

This process is carried out by certain prokaryotic microorganisms, categorized into two groups:

* **Symbiotic N₂ Fixers:**

  * Bacteria and fungi, mainly of the genus `Rhizobium`
  * These bacteria `enter the root cells of leguminous plants` (e.g., peas, groundnuts, beans, clovers) by breaking down the cell wall.
  * They multiply and form an enlargement called `legume nodules`, where nitrogen fixation occurs.

* **Free-living N₂ Fixers:**

  * **Aerobic bacteria:** `Azotobacter`
  * **Anaerobic bacteria:** `Clostridium`
  * **Blue-green algae:** `Anabaena`
  * These organisms combine atmospheric N₂ with hydrogen (obtained from the transpiratory pathway) to form **ammonia (`NH₃`)**, which then reacts with organic acids to produce `amino acids`.

`Nitrites, nitrates, and ammonia` formed during nitrogen fixation are `absorbed` by green plants and converted into nitrogenous organic compounds such as `amino acids, nucleic acids, proteins, enzymes, and hormones`.

Through this process, **organic nitrogen** is converted into **inorganic ammonia (NH₃)** or **ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)**.

* Ammonification plays a crucial role by providing `nitrogen to the soil in a usable form` for plants, enabling the transfer of nitrogen through the food chain.
* For many plant species growing in **acidic soils**, ammonification is the most effective method of obtaining nitrogen.
* However, adding `excessive fertilizers` to increase ammonia levels can lead to `algal overgrowth`, resulting in `soil toxicity` and `ecosystem imbalance`.

**Examples of ammonifying microorganisms:**
`Bacillus , Proteus,  Clostridium , Pseudomonas , and Streptomyces`.

![image](https://www.sciencefacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nitrification.jpg)

Nitrification is the **aerobic biological oxidation** of **ammonia (NH₃)** or **ammonium ions (NH₄⁺)** into **nitrate (NO₃⁻)**. It occurs in two distinct steps:

### Steps of Nitrification:

1. **Oxidation of ammonium (NH₄⁺) to nitrite (NO₂⁻)**

   * Carried out by *nitrosifying* or *ammonia-oxidizing bacteria*
   * Example organisms: *Nitrosomonas*, *Nitrococcus*

2. **Oxidation of nitrite (NO₂⁻) to nitrate (NO₃⁻)**

   * Carried out by *nitrite-oxidizing bacteria*
   * Example organisms: *Nitrobacter*, *Nitrospina*

### Nature of the Process:

* Nitrification is performed by **small groups of autotrophic bacteria and archaea**.
* It is an **aerobic process** (requires oxygen).
* The oxidation reactions are **energetically poor**, resulting in **slow growth rates** for the involved organisms.

### Chemical Reactions:

* **NH₄⁺ + 3 O₂ → 2 NO₂⁻ + 2 H₂O + 4 H⁺** (*Nitrosomonas*, *Nitrococcus*)
* **NO₂⁻ + O₂ → 2 NO₃⁻** (*Nitrobacter*, *Nitrospina*)

These reactions represent the oxidation (loss of electrons) of nitrogen compounds, enabling the nitrogen to progress further in the nitrogen cycle.

**flow** : `solution-to-rock`  |  `washed away`  |  `lock`  |  `wathering`

Sedimentation is the conversion of `nitrate solutions` present in the Earth's crust into `nitrate rocks`, either in the sea or in deeper layers of the Earth’s crust.

* **Process:** Nitrates in the soil are `washed away` into the sea or **leached deep into the Earth** through **percolating water**.

* These nitrates become `locked into rocks` and are no longer available to living organisms.

* **Release of Nitrogen:** Nitrogen trapped in rocks can be released only through `weathering`, which breaks down the rocks and allows the nitrates to re-enter the nitrogen cycle.
