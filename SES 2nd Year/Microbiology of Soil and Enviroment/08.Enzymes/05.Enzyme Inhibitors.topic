**Enzyme inhibitors** are molecules that `reduce or stop` the activity of enzymes by interfering with `substrate binding` or enzyme function.

### Types of Enzyme Inhibitors

| **Type**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                      | **Example**                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Competitive Inhibitors**     | Bind to the **active site**, competing with the substrate for binding. They can be overcome by increasing substrate concentration.                                   | `Methotrexate` inhibits `dihydrofolate` reductase (used in cancer treatment).            |
| **Non-Competitive Inhibitors** | Bind to an **allosteric site** (different from active site), causing a change in enzyme shape and function, reducing activity regardless of substrate concentration. | `Lead` inhibits enzymes by binding to sites other than active site.                    |
| **Feedback Inhibitors**        | End products of metabolic pathways bind to an enzyme early in the pathway (often allosterically) to inhibit its activity, regulating the pathway.                    | `Threonine` inhibits the enzyme `threonine deaminase` in its own biosynthetic pathway. |

| Inhibitor Type        | Binding Site    | Effect on Enzyme Activity                  | Overcome by Increasing Substrate? | Example                          |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Competitive           | Active site     | Blocks substrate binding                   | Yes                               | Methotrexate                     |
| Non-Competitive       | Allosteric site | Alters enzyme shape and function           | No                                | Lead                             |
| Feedback (Allosteric) | Allosteric site | Regulates metabolic pathways by inhibition | No                                | Threonine on threonine deaminase |</md></sn><config style="display:none"><tags>#05.enzyme inhibitors</tags><thumbnail></thumbnail><heading></heading><udate>Mon Jul 07 2025 11:27:26 GMT+0600 (Bangladesh Standard Time)</udate><id>article-hHaHCvZnA7</id><duration></duration></config>
