| **Term**                      | **Definition**                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Activation Energy**         | The minimum amount of energy required to start a chemical reaction by converting reactants into an activated (unstable) state.              |
| **Transition State (Energy)** | A high-energy, unstable state of the reactants during a chemical reaction; it represents the point at which bonds are breaking and forming. |

### How Enzymes Reduce Activation Energy

Enzymes reduce activation energy by:

* Binding the substrate at the **active site**, which correctly orients the molecules.
* **Stabilizing the transition state**, lowering the energy barrier.
* Inducing **strain** or favorable changes in the substrate to make bond-breaking/forming easier.
* **Creating a favorable microenvironment** (e.g., excluding water, donating/accepting protons).

As a result, the reaction occurs **faster and at lower energy input** than it would without the enzyme.

#### Real Example of a Reaction With and Without an Enzyme

#### Example: **Breakdown of Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)**

| **Condition**                                               | **Reaction**                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Without Enzyme**                                          | H₂O₂ breaks down very slowly on its own:                |
| `2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂` (high activation energy, slow reaction) |                                                         |
| **With Enzyme (Catalase)**                                  | The enzyme catalase speeds up the reaction drastically: |
| `2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂` (low activation energy, fast reaction)  |                                                         |

* **Catalase** reduces the activation energy from \~75 kJ/mol to \~23 kJ/mol.
* This is why **bubbling** is seen when catalase (from liver or potato) is added to hydrogen peroxide.
