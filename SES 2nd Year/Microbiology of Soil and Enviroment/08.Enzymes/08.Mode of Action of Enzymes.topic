Enzyme action involves a `highly specific interaction with substrate molecules`. This specificity and efficiency result from the enzymeâ€™s three-dimensional structure and active site. The mode of action generally follows these steps:

#### 1. **Substrate Binding**

* The substrate binds to a specific region of the enzyme called the `active site`.
* The fit may follow:

  * `Lock and Key Model`: The substrate fits exactly into the active site.
  * `Induced Fit Model`: The enzyme changes shape slightly to accommodate the substrate.

#### 2. **Formation of Enzyme-Substrate Complex**

* Binding forms a temporary `enzyme-substrate complex` that facilitates the chemical reaction.
* This lowers the `activation energy`, making the reaction proceed faster.

#### 3. **Catalysis**

* The enzyme `catalyzes the conversion of substrate into product` through a series of intermediate steps.
* The active site may `provide an acidic, basic, or hydrophobic environment` that facilitates bond-breaking and forming.

#### 4. **Product Release**

* The product has less `affinity` for the active site and is released.
* The enzyme remains `unchanged` and is free to catalyze another reaction cycle.
