##### **Definition:**

The **Lock and Key Hypothesis** explains how enzymes and substrates interact. It proposes that the `enzyme's active site` has a specific shape that exactly **matches the `shape of its substrate`**, like a key fits into a lock.

### **Key Features:**

| **Aspect**             | **Description**                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specificity**        | The enzyme will only bind to a substrate with the correct shape.                            |
| **No Change in Shape** | The enzyme’s active site is `rigid and unchanging` in this model.                         |
| **Temporary Binding**  | The substrate temporarily binds to the active site to form an **enzyme-substrate complex**. |
| **Reaction Occurs**    | The enzyme catalyzes the reaction, converting the substrate into products.                  |
| **Product Released**   | After the reaction, the product is released, and the enzyme remains unchanged.              |

### **Example:**

* `Sucrase` enzyme binds specifically with `sucrose` (not lactose or maltose) to break it into glucose and fructose.

---

### **Limitations:**

* The Lock and Key model does not explain the `flexibility` seen in many enzymes.
* It has been improved by the **Induced Fit Model**, which suggests the `enzyme changes shape slightly` to fit the substrate better.

##### **Definition:**

The **Induced Fit Model** suggests that the `enzyme's active site is flexible`, not rigid. When the **substrate approaches**, the enzyme undergoes a`conformational change` to `mold around the substrate`—**improving the fit** and facilitating the reaction.

### **Key Features:**

| **Aspect**                         | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flexibility**                    | The enzyme changes shape slightly when binding to the substrate.                                                          |
| **Stronger Binding**               | The induced fit increases the strength and specificity of binding.                                                        |
| **Transition State Stabilization** | The conformational change helps the enzyme better stabilize the substrate’s transition state, reducing activation energy. |
| **Dynamic Interaction**            | The enzyme-substrate complex is not a perfect match from the start but becomes one during interaction.                    |

### **Example:**

* `Hexokinase`, an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to glucose, changes its shape when glucose binds, aligning the active site perfectly for the reaction.

---

### **Comparison with Lock and Key:**

| **Feature**           | **Lock and Key**       | **Induced Fit**                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Active Site Shape** | Rigid and fixed        | Flexible and adjusts upon substrate entry |
| **Substrate Fit**     | Must be an exact match | Partial match is fine; enzyme adjusts     |
| **Binding Mechanism** | Passive binding        | Active molding to the substrate           |

---

The **Induced Fit Model** better explains the `enzyme's high specificity`, `flexibility`, and how some enzymes can `bind to` multiple `related substrates`.
