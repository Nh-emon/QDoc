### 1. **Cofactor**

* **Definition:** A non-protein component required by some enzymes for activity.
* **Types:**

  * **Inorganic:** Metal ions like Mg²⁺, Zn²⁺, Fe²⁺
  * **Organic:** Coenzymes and prosthetic groups
* **Example:**

  * **Mg²⁺** for DNA polymerase
  * **Zn²⁺** for carbonic anhydrase

---

### 2. **Apoenzyme**

* **Definition:** The **inactive protein part** of an enzyme, without its cofactor.
* **It becomes active only after the cofactor binds.**
* **Example:** Apo-carbonic anhydrase (inactive without Zn²⁺)

---

### 3. **Holoenzyme**

* **Definition:** The **complete, active enzyme** formed when an apoenzyme is combined with its cofactor.
* **Apoenzyme + Cofactor = Holoenzyme**
* **Example:** Carbonic anhydrase (apoenzyme + Zn²⁺)

---

### 4. **Coenzyme**

* **Definition:** A **small organic molecule**, often vitamin-derived, that acts as a **transient carrier** of specific atoms or functional groups.
* **Loosely bound to enzyme** and participates in reaction.
* **Example:**

  * **NAD⁺** (from Vitamin B3) in oxidation-reduction
  * **Coenzyme A** (from Vitamin B5) in fatty acid metabolism

---

### 5. **Prosthetic Group**

* **Definition:** A **tightly or permanently bound cofactor** to the enzyme's active site.
* Unlike coenzymes, it doesn’t detach during the reaction.
* **Example:**

  * **FAD** (derived from Vitamin B2) in succinate dehydrogenase
  * **Heme group** in cytochrome enzymes

| **Cofactor**         | Non-protein helper of enzyme         | Can be organic or inorganic | Mg²⁺, NAD⁺                |
| **Apoenzyme**        | Inactive protein part of enzyme      | —                           | Apo-carbonic anhydrase    |
| **Holoenzyme**       | Active enzyme (apoenzyme + cofactor) | —                           | Active carbonic anhydrase |
| **Coenzyme**         | Organic, loosely bound cofactor      | Loosely bound               | NAD⁺, Coenzyme A          |
| **Prosthetic Group** | Organic, tightly bound cofactor      | Tightly/permanently bound   | FAD, heme                 |
