Metabolism is the sum of all chemical reactions that occur within a living organism to maintain life.

Metabolism is divided into two main types:

##### Comparison Table: Catabolic vs Anabolic Reactions

| Feature                | **Catabolic Reactions**                          | **Anabolic Reactions**                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**         | Breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones | Synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones |
| **Energy**             | Releases energy (exergonic)                      | Requires energy input (endergonic)               |
| **Purpose**            | Provides energy and raw materials                | Builds cell structures and stores energy         |
| **Examples**           | Cellular respiration, digestion of food          | Photosynthesis, protein synthesis                |
| **Type of Reaction**   | Degradative                                      | Biosynthetic                                     |
| **Molecules Involved** | Large → small (e.g., proteins → amino acids)     | Small → large (e.g., amino acids → proteins)     |
| **ATP Role**           | Produces ATP                                     | Consumes ATP                                     |

##### Real Example
-  **Catabolic Reaction** : C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)
- **Anabolic Reaction**: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂</md></sn><sn class="p-lg-5"><md>### Enzyme

| **Term**                                 | **Definition**                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enzyme**                               | A biological catalyst, usually a protein, that speeds up chemical reactions without being consumed.                                 |
| **Substrate**                            | The specific reactant molecule that an enzyme acts upon during a biochemical reaction.                                              |
| **Active Site**                          | The specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds and the reaction occurs.                                                |
| **Allosteric Site**  | A site on the enzyme other than the active site, where a molecule can bind and change the enzyme's activity (increase or decrease). |
| **Enzyme-Substrate Complex**             | A temporary molecule formed when the enzyme binds to its substrate at the active site.                                              |
| **Enzyme-Product Complex**               | The intermediate structure formed after the reaction has occurred but before the product is released from the enzyme.               |
