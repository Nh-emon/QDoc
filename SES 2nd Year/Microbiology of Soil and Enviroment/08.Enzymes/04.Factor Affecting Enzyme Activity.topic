<sn><md>## Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity

Enzymes are highly sensitive to changes in their environment. The rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions depends on several internal and external factors. These factors can influence the structure of the enzyme, the binding of the substrate, and the overall efficiency of the reaction.

### 1. **Temperature**

#### Effect:

* Increases in temperature generally increase the rate of enzyme activity up to an optimal point (usually 35–40°C for human enzymes).
* Beyond the optimal temperature, enzyme activity rapidly decreases due to **denaturation** (loss of 3D structure).

#### Example:

* Human enzymes like **pepsin** (active in the stomach) function best around 37°C.

### 2. **pH Level**

#### Effect:

* Each enzyme has an **optimum pH** at which its activity is maximal.
* Changes in pH can alter the ionization of amino acid residues at the active site, disrupting enzyme-substrate binding.
* Extreme pH values may lead to enzyme denaturation.

#### Examples:

* **Pepsin** (stomach enzyme): Optimum pH \~2.
* **Trypsin** (intestinal enzyme): Optimum pH \~8.

### 3. **Substrate Concentration**

#### Effect:

* At low substrate concentrations, increasing the amount of substrate increases the reaction rate.
* Eventually, the rate **plateaus** when the enzyme becomes saturated (maximum velocity or **Vmax**).

#### Explanation:

* When all enzyme active sites are occupied, adding more substrate doesn’t increase the rate further.

### 4. **Enzyme Concentration**

#### Effect:

* Increasing enzyme concentration increases the reaction rate **only if substrate is in excess**.
* If substrate is limited, increasing enzymes has no further effect.

### 5. **Inhibitors**

Inhibitors are substances that reduce enzyme activity. They are of two major types:

#### A. **Competitive Inhibitors**

* Resemble the substrate and **compete** for the active site.
* Can be overcome by increasing substrate concentration.

#### B. **Non-Competitive Inhibitors**

* Bind to an enzyme **away from the active site** and change the enzyme’s shape.
* Cannot be overcome by increasing substrate concentration.

### 6. **Cofactors and Coenzymes**

* Some enzymes require **non-protein helpers** for activity:

  * **Cofactors**: Inorganic ions (e.g., Zn²⁺, Mg²⁺).
  * **Coenzymes**: Organic molecules (e.g., NAD⁺, FAD, vitamins).
* Their absence can reduce or stop enzyme function.

---

### 7. **Presence of Activators**

* Some substances (e.g., ions or small molecules) enhance enzyme activity.
* These **activators** may change the enzyme’s shape or help bind the substrate more effectively.

---

### 8. **Time and Reaction Duration**

* Enzyme activity may change over time due to:

  * Product inhibition
  * Enzyme degradation
  * Limited substrate availability

### Summary Table

| Factor                  | Effect on Enzyme Activity                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Temperature             | Increases rate until optimum; denatures at high temps |
| pH                      | Optimum pH needed; extremes cause denaturation        |
| Substrate Concentration | Increases rate until enzyme saturation (Vmax)         |
| Enzyme Concentration    | Increases rate if substrate is not limiting           |
| Inhibitors              | Reduce or block enzyme activity                       |
| Cofactors/Coenzymes     | Required for full activity in some enzymes            |
| Activators              | Enhance enzyme performance                            |
| Time                    | Activity may decrease over prolonged duration         |
