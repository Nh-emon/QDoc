---

1. **Temperature**

   * Activity increases with temperature up to an optimum point.
   * High temperatures may denature enzymes and reduce activity.

2. **pH**

   * Each enzyme has an optimum pH.
   * Too high or too low pH alters enzyme structure and reduces activity.

3. **Substrate Concentration**

   * Increasing substrate increases activity until enzymes are saturated.
   * Beyond saturation, the rate remains constant.

4. **Enzyme Concentration**

   * More enzymes increase reaction rate if substrate is available.

5. **Inhibitors**

   * **Competitive inhibitors** block the active site.
   * **Non-competitive inhibitors** bind elsewhere and change the enzyme's shape.

6. **Cofactors and Coenzymes**

   * Some enzymes require metal ions or coenzymes for activation.
   * Without them, enzyme activity is reduced or halted.

7. **Time**

   * Over time, enzymes can lose activity due to denaturation or substrate depletion.

---

1. **Temperature**

   * *Example:* **Human amylase** (in saliva) works best around **37°C**.
     If the temperature rises to **60°C**, the enzyme **denatures** and stops breaking down starch.

2. **pH**

   * *Example:* **Pepsin**, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, works best at **pH 2**.
     At **neutral or basic pH**, pepsin loses activity due to **change in structure**.

3. **Substrate Concentration**

   * *Example:* In a lab, increasing the amount of **hydrogen peroxide** increases the activity of **catalase**—until the enzyme becomes saturated.

4. **Enzyme Concentration**

   * *Example:* In milk industry, increasing **rennin enzyme** speeds up milk coagulation—if there’s enough casein substrate present.

5. **Inhibitors**

   * *Example:* **Penicillin** is a competitive inhibitor that blocks bacterial enzyme activity used for cell wall synthesis.

6. **Cofactors**

   * *Example:* **DNA polymerase** requires **magnesium ions (Mg²⁺)** as a cofactor to synthesize DNA.
     Without Mg²⁺, the enzyme cannot function properly.
