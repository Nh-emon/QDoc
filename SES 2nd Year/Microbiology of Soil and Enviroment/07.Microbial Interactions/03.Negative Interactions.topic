<sn><md>## Predation

Predation is a widespread biological interaction in which one organism (the `predator`) `attacks` or engulfs another organism (the `prey`).
The prey can be either **larger or smaller** than the predator, and this interaction usually results in the `death of the prey`.
Predator–prey interactions are typically of `short duration`.

#### Examples of Predation

1. **`Protozoan–Bacteria` in Soil**

   Many protozoans feed on diverse bacterial populations, helping maintain the bacterial count in soil at an optimum level.

2. `Predatory Bacteria`

   `Vampirococcus,Daptobacter`, and similar bacteria are examples of predators that can feed on a wide range of bacterial species.

![image](https://images.examples.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Parasitism-Examples.png)

**Definition** : Parasitism is a relationship in which one population, called the `parasite  benefits and derives its nutrition from another population`, the host, which is harmed in the process.

**Nature of Interaction** : The host-parasite relationship typically involves a `long period of contact`, which may be either physical or metabolic.

---
##### Types of Parasites :

  * `Ectoparasites`: Parasites that live `outside` the host's cells.
  * `Endoparasites`: Parasites that live `inside` the host's cells.

---
##### Example of Parasitism

  * Viruses are `obligate intracellular parasites` with high **host specificity**.
  * Many viruses parasitize a variety of organisms including **bacteria (bacteriophages)**, **fungi**, **algae**, and **protozoa**.

**Definition** : Competition is a negative interaction between two microbial populations, where `both populations are adversely affected` in terms of their survival and growth.

**Cause** : It occurs when both populations utilize the `same resources`, such as space or nutrients. This results in `reduced growth rate` or `lower maximum population density` for both groups.

**Resources for Competition** : Microbial populations compete for `growth-limiting resources` like:

  * Carbon sources
  * Nitrogen sources
  * Phosphorus
  * Vitamins
  * Growth factors

**Outcome** : Competition  prevents both populations from occupying the same ecological niche simultaneously. Eventually, `one population outcompetes` the other, leading to the elimination of the less competitive one.

##### Example of Competition

`Paramecium caudatum vs. Paramecium aurelia`:Both protozoan species feed on the **same bacterial population**.When placed together, they **compete** for food, negatively impacting the growth of both.

When one microbial population `produces substances that are inhibitory to another microbial population`, this interpopulation relationship is known as Amensalism or Antagonism.It is a negative relationship.

**Mechanism**: The microbial population that produces inhibitory substances remains unaffected or may even gain a competitive advantage and survive in the habitat.The other microbial populations are inhibited by these substances.This type of chemical inhibition is referred to as `antibiosis`.

#### Example of Antagonism

**Thiobacillus thiooxidans**:This microorganism oxidizes `sulfur` to produce `sulfuric acid`, which lowers the `pH` of the culture medium.The acidic environment `inhibits the growth` of most other bacteria.
