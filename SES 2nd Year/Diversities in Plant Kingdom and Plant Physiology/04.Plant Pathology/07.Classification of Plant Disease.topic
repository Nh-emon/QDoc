#### Based on Plant Part Affected{.text-center}

* **Localized:** Affect only `specific organs or parts` of the plant.
* **Systemic:** Affect the entire plant.
* **Examples:** Root diseases, stem diseases, foliage/foliar diseases, etc.

---

#### Based on Perpetuation and Spread{.text-center}

* **Soil-borne:** Pathogen perpetuates through the soil.
* **Seed-borne:** Pathogen perpetuates through seeds or other propagation materials.
* **Air-borne:** Disseminated by wind (e.g., rusts and powdery mildews).

---

####  Based on Signs and Symptoms Produced by Pathogens{.text-center}

Diseases are classified according to the most conspicuous symptom appearing on the host surface, such as:

* Rusts,Smuts
* Powdery mildews,Downy mildews
*  Wilts,Blights,Cankers
* Root rots,Fruit rots,Leaf spots

---

#### Based on Host Plants Affected{.text-center}

* Cereal,Forage,Flax diseases
* Millet,Plantation crop diseases
* Fruit,Vegetable,Flowering plant diseases

---

#### Based on Major Causes{.text-center}

* Fungal diseases
* Bacterial diseases
* Viral diseases
* Mycoplasmal diseases

#### Based on Infection Process{.text-center}


| Type of Disease    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Infectious**     | Caused by `animate agents` such as fungi, bacteria, viruses, and viroids. These diseases can be transmitted from infected to healthy plants.                                                                                                    |
| **Non-infectious** | Also called *non-parasitic* or *physiological disorders.* They cannot be transmitted to healthy plants and are caused by abiotic factors such as `nutrient deficiency or excess`, unfavorable soil or weather conditions, or mechanical injury. |
