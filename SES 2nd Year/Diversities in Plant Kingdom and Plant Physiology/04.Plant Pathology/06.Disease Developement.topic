Every infectious disease requires a `series of sequential events` in order for disease to develop.Specific events are unique for each disease.

#### General events are:
1. dispersal of the pathogen to the host
2. penetration and infection of the host
3. invasion and colonization of the host
4. reproduction of the pathogen
5. pathogen dispersal
6. pathogen survival between growing seasons and/or in the absence of a host</md></sn>

#### Pathogenesis and saprogenesis

Pathogenesis is the `stage` of disease in which the ++pathogen++ is in `intimate association` with ++living host tissue++. Three fairly distinct stages are involved:

* **Inoculation**: Transfer of the pathogen to the infection court, or area in which invasion of the plant occurs.The infection court may be 
  * The unbroken plant surface, 
  * a variety of wounds or natural openingsâ€”e.g.
  * stomata [microscopic pores in leaf surfaces]
  * hydathodes [stomata-like openings that secrete water]
  * lenticels [small openings in tree bark])

* **Incubation**: The `period of time` between the arrival of the pathogen in the infection court and the appearance of symptoms

* **Infection**: The `appearance of disease symptoms` accompanied by the establishment and spread of the pathogen.</md></sn><sn><md>### Plant Disease Cycle

Disease developement occurs over a period as a series of events.This `series of events` is called disease cycle.

The basic steps in most disease cycles are as follows :

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Inoculation | The process by which a pathogen comes into `contact` with the host plant, usually through spores, seeds, or infected tools. |
| Penetration | The `entry` of the pathogen into the host tissue through natural openings, wounds, or direct penetration. |
| Infection | The `establishment` of the pathogen within the host, starting the disease process and interfering with normal plant functions. |
| Growth and Reproduction | The pathogen `multiplies and spreads` within the host tissues, producing structures like spores or mycelium. |
| Dissemination | The `spread` of the pathogen from `one plant to another` by wind, water, insects, animals, or human activities. |
| Survival | The `pathogen remains alive` during unfavorable conditions through resting spores, infected debris, or alternate hosts. |
