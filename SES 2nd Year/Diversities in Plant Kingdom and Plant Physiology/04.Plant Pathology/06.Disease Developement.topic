Every infectious disease requires a `series of sequential events` in order for disease to develop.Specific events are unique for each disease.

#### General events are:
1. dispersal of the pathogen to the host
2. penetration and infection of the host
3. invasion and colonization of the host
4. reproduction of the pathogen
5. pathogen dispersal
6. pathogen survival between growing seasons and/or in the absence of a host</md></sn>

#### Pathogenesis and saprogenesis

Pathogenesis is the `stage` of disease in which the ++pathogen++ is in `intimate association` with ++living host tissue++. Three fairly distinct stages are involved:

* **Inoculation**: Transfer of the pathogen to the infection court, or area in which invasion of the plant occurs.The infection court may be 
  * The unbroken plant surface, 
  * a variety of wounds or natural openingsâ€”e.g.
  * stomata [microscopic pores in leaf surfaces]
  * hydathodes [stomata-like openings that secrete water]
  * lenticels [small openings in tree bark])

* **Incubation**: The `period of time` between the arrival of the pathogen in the infection court and the appearance of symptoms

* **Infection**: The `appearance of disease symptoms` accompanied by the establishment and spread of the pathogen.</md></sn>
