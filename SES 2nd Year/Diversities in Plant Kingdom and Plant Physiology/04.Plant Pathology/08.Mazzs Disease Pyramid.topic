The **Disease Triangle** is a fundamental concept in plant pathology that explains the conditions required for a disease to occur. It states that **disease develops only when three factors interact simultaneously**:

1. **Host** – a susceptible plant or crop.
2. **Pathogen** – a disease-causing organism (fungus, bacteria, virus, etc.).
3. **Environment** – favorable conditions (temperature, humidity, soil, etc.) that allow the pathogen to infect the host.

If **any one of these three factors is missing or unfavorable**, disease will **not occur**.

### Diagram:

```
         Pathogen
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        /      \
    Host--------Environment
```

**Key Points:**

* Host must be `susceptible`.
* Pathogen must be `virulent`.
* Environment must favor disease development.

This triangle helps in **disease management** by controlling one or more of the factors, e.g., using resistant varieties (host), applying fungicides (pathogen), or altering cultural practices (environment).

<sn><md>## Maas’ Disease Pyramid

The **Maas Disease Pyramid** is an `extension` of the traditional Disease Triangle. It adds a `fourth factor, time`, to explain disease development more comprehensively.

#### Four Components:
1. **Host** – The susceptible plant or crop.
2. **Pathogen** – The disease-causing organism (fungus, bacteria, virus, etc.).
3. **Environment** – Favorable conditions (temperature, humidity, soil, etc.).
4. **Time** – Duration over which the host, pathogen, and environment interact.

```
             Pathogen
                /\
               /  \
              /    \
             /      \
    Host --------- Environment
               \
                \
                 Time
```

**Key Points:**

* Disease severity often increases with **longer duration** of favorable conditions.
* This model helps explain why some diseases appear suddenly and others take longer to develop.
* Management strategies can target **any of the four factors** to reduce disease impact.
* The `human` equation can affect the three components of the disease triangle and should be considered as a `fifth component` in disease development.</md></sn><sn><md>### Factors Affecting Disease Development
