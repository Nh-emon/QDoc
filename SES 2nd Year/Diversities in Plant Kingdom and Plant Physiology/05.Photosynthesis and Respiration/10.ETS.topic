The **Electron Transport System (ETS)** is the `final stage` of aerobic respiration, occurring in the **inner mitochondrial membrane**. It is responsible for `producing the maximum amount of ATP` by ++transferring electrons through a sequence of carriers++.

* The **electron transport chain (ETC)** is a series of electron carriers located in the **inner membrane of mitochondria**.
* Electrons released from **NADH and FADH₂** are passed from one carrier to another through a series of **redox reactions**.
* As electrons flow through the chain, energy is released and used to **pump protons (H⁺)** across the membrane, creating a **proton gradient**.
* This gradient provides the force for **ATP formation** when protons flow back through **ATP synthase**. This ATP formation through proton movement is called **chemiosmosis**.
* At the end of the chain, electrons combine with **oxygen (the final electron acceptor)** and hydrogen ions to form **water**.
* Because oxygen is required directly at the end of the chain, the entire process is part of **aerobic respiration**.</md></sn>
