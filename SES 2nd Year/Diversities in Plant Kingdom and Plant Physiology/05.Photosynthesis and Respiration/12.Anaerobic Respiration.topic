Anaerobic respiration is the process by which **cells generate energy without using oxygen**. It is an ancient form of energy production, occurring in **many microorganisms** and some animal cells when oxygen is scarce. Unlike aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration **yields less ATP per glucose molecule**.


#### Key Features of Anaerobic Respiration

* Occurs **without oxygen**.
* Produces **2 ATP per glucose** (net) through glycolysis.
* Involves **fermentation pathways** to regenerate NAD⁺ for glycolysis.
* End products vary depending on the organism and pathway: **lactic acid, ethanol, CO₂, or other organic acids**.


Anaerobic respiration is **less efficient than aerobic respiration**, but it allows organisms to survive and produce ATP **in environments lacking oxygen**.

<sn><md>### Fermentation

Fermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration where **pyruvate from glycolysis is converted into different end products** to regenerate NAD⁺, allowing glycolysis to continue.

There are two main types of fermentation in living organisms:
</md></sn><sn><md>### Alcoholic Fermentation{.text-center}

* **Occurs in:** Yeasts, some bacteria
* **Purpose:** Regenerate NAD⁺ from NADH to maintain glycolysis
* **Process:** Pyruvate is first decarboxylated to acetaldehyde and CO₂, then reduced to ethanol.
* **Net Reaction (per glucose molecule):**

$$
\text{Glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{Ethanol} + 2 \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{ATP}
$$

* **Applications:** Brewing, wine, beer, and bioethanol production.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Lactic Acid Fermentation{.text-center}

* **Occurs in:** Animal muscle cells (during intense exercise), some bacteria
* **Purpose:** Regenerate NAD⁺ from NADH to allow glycolysis to continue
* **Process:** Pyruvate is directly reduced by NADH to form **lactic acid**.
* **Net Reaction (per glucose molecule):**

$$
\text{Glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{Lactic Acid} + 2 \text{ATP}
$$

* **Applications:** Yogurt, cheese production, and temporary energy supply in muscles.
* **Note:** Accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle fatigue and soreness.
