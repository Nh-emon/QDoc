Respiration is the `biochemical process` through which living organisms `release energy from food`. It occurs in multiple steps, starting from the simple exchange of gases to complex cellular reactions `inside mitochondria`.

* **Breathing** :<br>
Breathing is the **physical process** of taking in oxygen (inhalation) and releasing carbon dioxide (exhalation). It is a mechanical activity carried out by lungs in animals.
* **External Respiration** : <br>
External respiration is the **exchange of gases between the lungs and the blood**. Oxygen diffuses into the blood, and carbon dioxide diffuses out.
* **Internal Respiration** : <br>
Internal respiration is the **exchange of gases between the blood and body tissues**. Oxygen enters the cells, and carbon dioxide (from tissues) enters the blood.
* **Cellular Respiration** :
Cellular respiration is a **biochemical process inside cells** where glucose is broken down to release energy in the form of ATP. It occurs in the cytoplasm and mitochondria.

<sn><md>### Basic Concept of Respiration

* Respiration releases the stored energy of food molecules.
* It involves oxidation of glucose.
* The final product is ATP, which drives all cellular work.
* Carbon dioxide and water are formed as end products in aerobic respiration.

#### Aerobic Respiration{.text-center}
* Occurs **in the presence of oxygen**.
* Complete breakdown of glucose.
* Produces **large amount of ATP** (36–38 ATP).
* Happens in mitochondria.
:::

#### Anaerobic Respiration{.text-center}
* Occurs **without oxygen**.
* Incomplete breakdown of glucose.
* Produces **very little ATP** (2 ATP).
* Produces **ethanol + CO₂** in yeast and **lactic acid** in animals.

</md></sn><sn><md>### Mechanism of Respiration

Respiration occurs through a **series of enzymatic steps**:

1. **Glycolysis** – glucose is partially oxidized in the cytoplasm.
2. **Formation of Acetyl Co-A** – pyruvate enters mitochondria and forms Acetyl Co-A.
3. **Krebs Cycle** – Acetyl Co-A is oxidized to CO₂, producing NADH and FADH₂.
4. **Electron Transport System (ETS)** – electrons flow through proteins, releasing energy to form ATP.
5. **Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor**, forming water.

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-md-6
 Glycolysis (Cytoplasm)
* First stage of respiration.
* Glucose → 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH
* Anaerobic organisms stop here.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
Acetyl Co-A Formation (Link Reaction)
* Pyruvate enters mitochondria.
* Pyruvate → Acetyl Co-A + CO₂ + NADH
* Connects glycolysis to Krebs cycle.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
Krebs Cycle (Mitochondrial Matrix)
* Acetyl Co-A enters cycle.
* Produces:

  * CO₂
  * NADH &amp; FADH₂
  * ATP
* Releases electrons for ETS.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
Electron Transport System (Inner Mitochondrial Membrane)
* NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons.
* Electrons flow through complexes, creating proton gradient.
* ATP is formed by **ATP synthase**.
* Oxygen combines with hydrogen to form **water**.
