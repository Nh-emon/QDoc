* Plant growth is influenced by a combination of `internal and external signals`. These signals operate through **plant growth-regulating substances**, commonly known as **plant hormones** or **phytohormones** (from the Greek *hormaein*, meaning *“to excite”*). 
* These substances do not directly control every growth process, but they are `essential for coordinating and regulating` many stages of plant development. 
* Their effects depend on two major factors: the **concentration of the hormone present** and the **sensitivity of the specific plant tissue** receiving the signal.

#### Phytohormone

* &gt; A phytohormone is a `naturally occurring, organic chemical` produced in minute quantities within a plant and transported to different tissues where it `influences physiological processes`. 
* These hormones act as `chemical messengers` that help coordinate growth, development, and environmental responses.
