* Plant growth is influenced by a combination of `internal and external signals`. These signals operate through **plant growth-regulating substances**, commonly known as **plant hormones** or **phytohormones** (from the Greek *hormaein*, meaning *“to excite”*). 
* These substances do not directly control every growth process, but they are `essential for coordinating and regulating` many stages of plant development. 
* Their effects depend on two major factors: the **concentration of the hormone present** and the **sensitivity of the specific plant tissue** receiving the signal.

#### Phytohormone

* &gt; A phytohormone is a `naturally occurring, organic chemical` produced in minute quantities within a plant and transported to different tissues where it `influences physiological processes`. 
* These hormones act as `chemical messengers` that help coordinate growth, development, and environmental responses.

<sn><md>### What Phytohormones Do to Plants

Phytohormones regulate a wide range of activities in plants:

* Stimulate or inhibit growth
* Control cell division and cell elongation
* Influence root and shoot formation
* Regulate flowering, fruiting, and seed development
* Coordinate responses to environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and light changes
* Trigger dormancy or senescence

The overall effect depends on the **hormone type**, **amount**, and **interaction with other hormones**.
</md></sn><sn><md>## Types of Plant Growth Regulators {.text-center}

### Natural vs. Synthetic Regulators

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Natural Plant Regulators {.text-center .fg-teal}

These are `produced naturally` within plant tissues.
Examples include:

* Auxins
* Gibberellins
* Cytokinins
* Ethylene
* Abscisic Acid

They maintain internal regulation of plant physiology.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Synthetic Plant Regulators {.text-center .fg-blue}

These are `artificially produced` compounds used in agriculture and horticulture to mimic or modify natural hormone activity.
Examples:

* NAA (Naphthalene Acetic Acid)
* 2,4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)
* CCC (Chlormequat chloride)

They are used for rooting, fruit set, growth control, and weed management.

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Growth Promoters {.text-center}
These hormones stimulate growth-related activities such as cell division, elongation, and differentiation.
Major promoters:

* **Auxins**
* **Gibberellins**
* **Cytokinins**

Their functions include root initiation, stem elongation, overcoming dormancy, and enhancing fruit development.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Growth Inhibitors {.text-center}

These substances slow down or suppress growth.
Key inhibitors:

* **Abscisic Acid (ABA)** – induces dormancy and stress resistance
* **Ethylene** – promotes fruit ripening but may inhibit growth in many tissues

They play crucial roles in controlling unwanted or excessive growth and preparing plants for stress conditions.

</md></sn><sn><md>### Endogenous vs. Exogenous Regulators

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Endogenous Regulators{.text-center}
Produced internally by the plant.<br>
These include all natural plant hormones that arise in roots, shoots, meristems, or developing seeds.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Exogenous Regulators
Applied from outside the plant (spraying, dipping, or soil application).<br>
These can be:

* Synthetic compounds
* Natural plant extracts
* Commercial formulations

They are used to control agricultural processes like rooting, fruit growth, or delaying senescence.
:::
:::</md></sn><sn><md>### Primary vs. Secondary Regulators

:::.row
:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Primary Regulators{.text-center}
Well-established, major hormones responsible for essential developmental processes.<br>
These include:

* Auxins
* Gibberellins
* Cytokinins
* Ethylene
* Abscisic Acid

They are universally recognized and thoroughly studied.
:::

:::.col-12 .col-md-6
#### Secondary Regulators
Compounds that influence growth but are not considered core hormones. They may act indirectly or be involved in stress and defense responses.<br>
Examples:

* Jasmonates
* Salicylic acid
* Brassinosteroids

These regulators often modulate specialized or conditional physiological responses.

</md></sn><sn><md>### Other Plant Regulators (Not Yet Confirmed or Newly Discovered)

There are several plant-derived compounds whose hormonal roles are still under investigation. These are not fully categorized but show regulatory potential:

* Strigolactones
* Polyamines
* Peptides and small RNAs
* Karrikins (smoke-derived chemicals influencing germination)

These substances open new fields of research into plant signalling and developmental biology.
