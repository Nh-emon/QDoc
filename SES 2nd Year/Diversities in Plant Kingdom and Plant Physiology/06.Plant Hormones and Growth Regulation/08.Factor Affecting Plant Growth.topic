### Light

Light is essential for `photosynthesis`, the process by which plants produce food. The `intensity`, `duration` (photoperiod), and `quality` (wavelength) of light influence plant height, leaf size, flowering, and overall productivity.<br> 
++Insufficient light++ leads to `weak, elongated plants`,<br> 
while ++too much light++ can cause `leaf burn`.

### Water

Water is required for `nutrient transport`, `photosynthesis`, `cell turgor`, and `metabolic activities`. Both **water deficiency** and **water excess** affect growth. <br>
++Too little water++ causes `wilting and reduced growth`, <br>
while ++overwatering++ leads to `poor aeration and root rot`.

### Temperature

Temperature regulates `enzyme activity`, `respiration`, `germination`, and `flowering`. Each plant has an `optimal temperature range` for growth.Too low or too high temperatures slow physiological processes and may cause `stress, affecting growth and development`.

### Nutrients

Plants require `macro- and micronutrients` for structural and physiological functions. Macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) are needed in larger amounts, while micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl) are needed in small amounts. Nutrient **deficiency or excess** leads to `visible disorders` and `reduced growth`.
