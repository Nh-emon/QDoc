**Genetic diversity** refers to the `diversity within a species`. It represents the variety of genes expressed at the genetic level by each individual within a species.

* No two individuals belonging to the same species are exactly similar. For example, in the species of human beings, each person shows a great deal of diversity compared to another. People living in different regions exhibit noticeable genetic variations.

* This variation forms the basis for `natural selection` and `adaptation` to changing environmental conditions, making it highly important for the survival of a species. If, in the future, there is an outbreak of disease in a crop, all plants could be affected if they are genetically similar. Hence, genetic diversity is also crucial for the **evolution of new species**.

* It is found both **within** and **between populations** of a species. Examples include variations among humans (*Homo sapiens*) from different continents like Asia and Africa, or among different varieties of rice (*Oryza sativa*) and mango (*Mangifera indica*).

* This variation arises from `differences in the genetic makeup` (nucleotide sequence of DNA) of organisms. It involves the occurrence of different versions of a gene (**alleles**) and various combinations of genes among individuals of a species.

* Sources of genetic variation include `genetic recombination` (meiosis, crossing over, and sexual reproduction) and **spontaneous mutations** in DNA. Therefore, no two individuals of a population are ever completely identical (except identical twins); `there is always some degree of genetic difference`.
