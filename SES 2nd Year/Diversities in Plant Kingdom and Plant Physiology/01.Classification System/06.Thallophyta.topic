* These are the `lowermost` plants of the plant kingdom, `without a well-differentiated` body design. This means that the plant body is not differentiated as roots, stem, and leaves.
* Thallophytes `lack a well-differentiated body` structure and the plant body is thallus like.
* The plant `body is thallus`, they may be filamentous, colonial, branched or unbranched.
* Examples include green algae, red algae and brown `algae`. Common examples are `Volvox`, Fucus, Spirogyra, Chara, Polysiphonia, Ulothrix, etc.

<sn><md>### Importance of Algae

1. Algae produce a large portion of the worldâ€™s `oxygen` through photosynthesis.
2. They serve as the `base of aquatic food chains`, supporting marine and freshwater life.
3. Algae are used as food for humans and animals (e.g., seaweeds like `Spirulina`).
4. They are valuable in industries for producing `agar, algin, and biofuels`.
5. Algae help in `wastewater treatment` by absorbing nutrients and pollutants.
