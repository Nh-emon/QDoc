<sn><md>### Importance of Bryophyte

1. Bryophytes help in `soil formation` by breaking down rocks through biological weathering.
2. They `prevent soil erosion` by forming dense mats that hold soil together.
3. Bryophytes like *Sphagnum* (peat moss) are used as `fuel and soil conditioners`.
4. They serve as `pioneer plants in barren areas`, preparing the land for other vegetation.
5. Bryophytes `provide habitat and moisture` for small organisms in forest ecosystems.
