* Angiosperms are `seed-bearing` vascular plants with a well-differentiated plant body.
* The seeds of angiosperms are `enclosed within the fruits`.
* Angiosperms are widely distributed and vary greatly in size, e.g. `Wolffia` is small measuring
about 0.1 cm and `Eucalyptus` trees are around 100 m tall.
* Angiosperms are further divided into- `monocoty`ledons and `dicoty`ledons according to the number of cotyledons present in the seeds. 
* Monocots have seeds with `single seed` leaf, having vascular bundles arranged in a complex manner. 
* Dicots, on the other hand, have `two cotyledons`. The `vascular bundle `is arranged in a `ring`.

Some of the common examples are mango, rose, tomato, onion, wheat, maize, etc.</md></sn>
