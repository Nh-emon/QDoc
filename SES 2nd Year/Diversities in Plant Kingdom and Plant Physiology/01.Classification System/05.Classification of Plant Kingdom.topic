| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kingdom**    | **Plantae (Plant Kingdom)**                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Definition** | Kingdom Plantae includes all plants. They are eukaryotic, multicellular, and autotrophic organisms. The plant cell contains a rigid cell wall, chloroplasts, and chlorophyll pigment, which are essential for photosynthesis. |

### **Characteristics of Kingdom Plantae**

| **Features**   | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Motility       | Plants are non-motile.                                                            |
| Nutrition      | They make their own food through photosynthesis, so they are autotrophic.         |
| Reproduction   | Reproduce sexually or asexually (vegetative propagation).                         |
| Cell Structure | Multicellular eukaryotes with a rigid cell wall and a large central vacuole.      |
| Pigments       | Contain photosynthetic pigments like chlorophyll in plastids.                     |
| Organ Systems  | Have specialized organs for anchorage, reproduction, support, and photosynthesis. |

| **Criteria**        | **Description**                                                                                  | **Examples**                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Plant Body**      | Based on presence or absence of a well-differentiated plant body such as root, stem, and leaves. | Thallophyta (undifferentiated), Bryophyta, Pteridophyta (differentiated).                  |
| **Vascular System** | Presence or absence of vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) for water and nutrient transport.     | Bryophyta (absent), Pteridophyta, Gymnosperms, Angiosperms (present).                      |
| **Seed Formation**  | Based on presence or absence of seeds, and whether seeds are naked or enclosed in fruits.        | Pteridophyta (no seeds), Gymnosperms (naked seeds), Angiosperms (seeds enclosed in fruit). |

### **Major Divisions of Plant Kingdom**

| **Division**     | **Description**                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thallophyta**  | Simple, body not differentiated into root, stem, and leaves. E.g. Algae                                                 |
| **Bryophyta**    | Amphibians of the plant kingdom; have root-like, stem-like, and leaf-like structures but no vascular tissues. E.g. Moss |
| **Pteridophyta** | Have vascular tissues and differentiated body parts but do not produce seeds. E.g. Ferns                                |
| **Gymnosperms**  | Produce naked seeds not enclosed in fruit. E.g. Pine, Cycas                                                             |
| **Angiosperms**  | Flowering plants with seeds enclosed within fruits. E.g. Mango, Rose                                                    |
