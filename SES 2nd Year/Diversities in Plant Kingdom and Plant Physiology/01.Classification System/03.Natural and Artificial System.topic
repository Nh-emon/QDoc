* Artificial systems were the `earliest systems`, which attempted to classify organisms based on a `few superficial characters`.
* These were important in the history of biological classification as this was a `novel attempt` to organise living organisms.
* The demerit was that it didnâ€™t consider `morphological details and the evolutionary
relationship`.
* They gave `equal importance` to `vegetative and sexual characters` but it is not
true. 
* Vegetative characters are greatly influenced by the environment. As a result, the closely related species were kept apart.

`Aristotle` classified plants more than *2000 years ago* on the basis of `simple morphological characters` into **herb, shrub and trees**.

`Theophrastus` in his book `Historia Plantarum or Enquiry into plants` attempted to arrange plants in various groups based on how plants `reproduce and its uses`. He is called ++Father of Botany++.

`Carl Linnaeus` is known as the `Father of Modern Taxonomy`. In his book `Systema Naturae` (1735), he gave the hierarchical system of classification of the natural world into the `plant` kingdom, the `animal` kingdom and `mineral` kingdom.

He understood the importance of `floral characters` and classified plants based on the `number of stamens present` in them. It is also known as the `sexual system of classification`. He divided the `plant kingdom into 24 classes` based on the structure,union, length and the number of stamens.

| Term             | Description                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monoandria**   | Flowers having `1` stamen                                       |
| **Diandria**     | `2` stamens                                      |
| **Polyandria**   | more than `12` stamens                           |
| **Monoadelphia** | Stamens `united into a single bundle`                           |
| **Monoecia**     | **Male and female flowers** present on the `same plant`         |
| **Dioecia**      | **Male and female flowers** present on `separate plants`        |
| **Polygamia**    | **Polygamous plants** having both `unisexual and bisexual flowers`  |
| **Cryptogamia**  | **Flowerless plants**, reproducing by `spores instead of seeds` |

* In this system of classification, `more characters were considered` while classifying. It was based on
the natural similarities of vegetative and floral characters among the organisms. It took into
consideration various external and internal features like the `anatomy of a cell, types of embryo and
phytochemistry`.

* `Bentham and Hooker system of classification` was the most important natural system of
classification `of flowering plants`. They classified plants into `Cryptogams` (non-flowering plants) and
`Phanerogams` (flowering plants).

* In the Bentham and Hooker classification system, `97,205 species` of seed plants were classified into
7569 genera and `202 families`. The flowering plants were further classified into three classes namely
`Dico`tyledon, `Gymnosperm` and `Monoco`tyledon.

* The Bentham and Hooker system of classification was published in the book `Genera Plantarum` in
three issues over the years 1862 to 1883.

* It helped to determine relationships between the various groups of plants but `failed to identify
phylogenetic relationships` among different groups of plants. It `wrongly placed gymnosperms
between monocotyledons and dicotyledons`.
