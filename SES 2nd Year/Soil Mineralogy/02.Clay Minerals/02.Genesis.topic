* Clay originates mainly through the `chemical alteration, weathering, and decomposition` of pre-existing rocks and minerals. The formation process depends on environmental conditions such as `climate, parent material, water availability, and time`. Because clay minerals are ++secondary minerals++, they `do not form directly from magma` but develop as older minerals break down.

* The most important source of clay is the `weathering of feldspar-rich rocks`, especially granite.<br> `Feldspars undergo hydrolysis` when exposed to water and carbon dioxide, producing kaolinite, illite, or smectite depending on conditions.<br> `Mica` minerals like *biotite* and *muscovite* also alter into ++illite or vermiculite++. <br>`Ferromagnesian` minerals such as *pyroxene* and *amphibole* weather into ++smectite or chlorite++. <br>`Volcanic ash` and glass can transform into *amorphous clays* such as ++allophane++, which later may convert into crystalline smectite.

* Clay formation occurs mainly through three geological processes: **chemical weathering**, **hydrothermal alteration**, and **diagenesis**. Chemical weathering is the dominant mechanism in surface environments, where rainfall, organic acids, and CO₂-rich water break down minerals. Hydrothermal alteration involves reactions with hot, mineral-rich fluids, often near volcanic or geothermal areas, producing clays like kaolinite and smectite. Diagenesis occurs in sedimentary basins where pressure, temperature, and pore-water chemistry transform existing clay minerals during burial.

* Environmental conditions strongly influence which clay mineral forms. **Humid tropical climates** favor intense leaching and produce kaolinite. **Temperate climates** often yield illite. **Arid and semi-arid climates** with limited leaching encourage the formation of smectite. The balance of water flow, ion concentration, temperature, and pH determines the final clay type.

* Clay may remain in place as **residual clay** or be transported by water, wind, or ice to form **sedimentary clay deposits**. Over geological time, transported clays can accumulate in lakes, rivers, floodplains, and marine environments, where further alteration and compaction occur.
