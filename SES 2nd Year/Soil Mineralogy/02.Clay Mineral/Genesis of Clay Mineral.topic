Clay minerals are **hydrous silicates or aluminosilicates** formed mainly through `transformation or weathering of primary minerals`. The key processes include:

* Detrital inheritance
* Physical or chemical alteration of primary minerals
* Decomposition followed by recrystallization

<sn><md>### Detrital Inheritance

Clay minerals in **hot dry or cold dry** climates—where `chemical weathering is minimal`—are largely `inherited from parent materials`.

**Examples:**

* Sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated deposits are usually inherited.
* Strong association exists between the clay type in parent material and the soil clay type.
* Micas in sand and silt fractions indicate dominance of illitic minerals in alluvium derived from such deposits.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Alteration

Alteration involves `slight physical or chemical changes` **without** alteration of the basic mineral structure.

**Examples:**

* **Muscovite → fine-grained mica (illite):**<br>
  Partial K loss,<br>addition of Si from weathering solution,<br>structural breakdown into colloidal-size particles; <br>illite acquires electronegative charge with <br>partially exchangeable K.
* **Biotite → vermiculite:**<br>
  Transition involves exclusion of K from biotite.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Recrystallization

Occurs under `intensive weathering`, involving `complete breakdown of the original crystal structure` and formation of new minerals.

**Examples:**

* Formation of **kaolinite** from solutions rich in Si and Al derived from breakdown of 2:1 structures; multiple mineral types may form.
* **Volcanic glass → halloysite** through allophanes.
</md></sn><sn><md>### Conditions Suitable for Formation of Individual Clay Minerals

Local `parent material and weathering conditions` determine clay mineral types in soils.

* Well-drained, well-weathered soils of humid/subhumid tropics are dominated by ++Fe and Al oxides++.
* `Kaolinite` occurs with ++hydrous oxide clays in tropical regions++.
* `Smectite, vermiculite, and fine-grained mica `dominate areas with ++less intense weathering++.
* `Fine-grained micas` dominate where parent material or soil solution is ++high in potassium++.
