Regular Mixed Layer Type

These minerals contain ++two silica tetrahedral layers++, ++one alumina-dominated octahedral layer++, and ++one magnesium-dominated octahedral layer++.Soil **chlorites** belong to this group.

Chlorites are **iron–magnesium silicates** with some aluminium. Their structure consists of:

* A **vermiculite-like layer**
  – Two silica tetrahedral sheets where part of the Si is replaced by Al
  – One Mg–Fe dominated octahedral sheet (Al replaced by Mg/Fe)

* A **brucite layer**
  – A separate Mg-octahedral sheet forming an additional octahedral layer

Thus, each crystal unit contains **two tetrahedral sheets** and **two Mg-dominated trioctahedral sheets**, resulting in a **2:1:1** (also called **2:2**) structural type.
