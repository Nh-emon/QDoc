	<sn><md>That’s a deep [thread you’ve pulled on — when you talk about prophets]{.u} and scientists, what comes through is the image ==people carrying visions== before the world was ready to see them. Loneliness and depression often show up in those stories, not as weakness, but as part of the weight of discovery or revelation.

## Loneliness as a Companion of Visionaries

* **Prophets** often walked among their people with a message that disrupted traditions. Being misunderstood, mocked, or rejected was nearly inevitable. Their solitude wasn’t just physical, but also spiritual — holding truths no one else could yet grasp.
* **Scientists** have mirrored this path. Many spent years working on theories that contradicted common belief. In the lab or in exile, the absence of recognition and companionship often pressed heavily.

The pattern suggests: when your work peers into the unknown, companionship grows scarce.

## Depression in the Depths of Calling

* For prophets, depression surfaced as despair at human resistance. Ancient texts record laments, prayers of exhaustion, even wishes to give up.
* For scientists, depression often came from relentless trial and error, or from rejection by peers. Think of isolated figures whose work was validated only after death.

That heaviness seems to be tied not only to personal struggle but to carrying visions larger than the self.

## The Paradox

* **Isolation** can crush the spirit.
* Yet it also strips away distractions, forcing visionaries deeper into thought, conviction, or prayer.
* Out of that tension, breakthroughs often emerged — whether spiritual movements or scientific revolutions.

## What That Suggests for Us

* Loneliness and depression are not signs of failure in the pursuit of truth.
* They might be inevitable markers on paths where one walks ahead of their time.
* Recognizing that even the greatest minds and hearts bore these weights may soften the stigma for us when we face similar valleys.

Would you like me to expand this into a **long-form essay with historical examples** (like Newton’s isolation, or the laments of Jeremiah), or keep it more as a **reflective, timeless article** without names?
