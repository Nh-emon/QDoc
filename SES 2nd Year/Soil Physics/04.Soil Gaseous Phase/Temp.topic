Soil compaction is the artificial and mechanical process of `increasing the density of soil` by packing soil particles closer together, resulting in a `reduction of air volume` within the soil pores.

#### Effects of Soil Compaction

* Compaction usually `reduces plant root proliferation`.
* It `lowers` the rate of both `water and air movement`.
* Slower internal drainage leads to `poor subsurface drainage` performance.
* Causes `increased denitrification` and `decreased crop production`.
* Higher compaction `increases the energy` required for tractor operations and subsequent tillage.
* Most effects are harmful; however, **slight compaction near seeds** can `help germination` and improve `plant growth under low-moisture conditions` (low rainfall or low water-holding capacity soils).

<sn><md>#### What is Soil Aeration?

Soil aeration is the `rapid exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide` between the soil pore space and the atmosphere. This exchange prevents **oxygen deficiency** and/or **carbon dioxide toxicity** in the soil air.

A well-aerated soil contains sufficient oxygen to support:

* Root respiration
* Aerobic microbial activities
* Oxidation reactions at optimum rates
