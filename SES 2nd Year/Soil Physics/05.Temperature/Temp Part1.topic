  <sn><md>### Soil Temperature

Soil temperature refers to the `warmth found within the soil body`, influenced by solar radiation, atmospheric conditions, soil properties, vegetation, and moisture. It `controls` a wide variety of `biological, chemical, and physical` processes such as ++seed germination, root growth, microbial activity, nutrient availability, and water movement++. Because the soil acts as both a **heat sink** and a **heat source**, understanding soil temperature is essential in agriculture, ecology, geology, and climate studies.

Soil temperature changes both **spatially** and **temporally**—varying with depth, season, time of day, and surface conditions. It reflects the heat exchange among three major environmental components: the **atmosphere**, **lithosphere**, and **hydrosphere**.

#### Atmosphere

* The atmosphere receives heat primarily from the Earth’s surface through **radiation**, **conduction**, and **convection**.
* Air temperature `fluctuates rapidly` because air has a `low heat capacity`, meaning it warms and cools quickly.
* Atmospheric conditions—`cloud cover, humidity, and wind`—strongly influence soil temperature.
* At night, longwave radiation loss cools the air and the soil surface, while daytime solar input warms them.

#### Lithosphere (Earth’s Crust and Soil Layer)

* The `upper part of the lithosphere` includes the **soil layer**, where temperature is `highly dynamic`.
* Soil temperature is controlled by:

  * Solar radiation at the surface
  * Soil texture and structure
  * Soil moisture
  * Organic matter content
  * Vegetation or surface cover
* Heat moves in the soil mainly by `conduction`, and deeper layers show **less variation** than surface soil.
* The lithosphere acts as a `long-term heat reservoir`, slowly releasing or absorbing thermal energy.

#### Hydrosphere

* The hydrosphere (oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater) greatly moderates temperature because water has a `high heat capacity`.
* Water bodies `heat more slowly and cool more slowly` than the atmosphere or soil.
* Soil temperature is affected by:

  * Moisture content in soil
  * Proximity to water bodies
  * Groundwater movement
* Wet soils warm more slowly but retain heat longer.
</md></sn><sn><md>#### Temperature Variability in the Atmosphere{.text-center}

* `Diurnal Variability:`

  * Air temperature increases after sunrise and peaks in mid-afternoon.
  * Minimum temperature occurs just before sunrise.
  * Cloud cover reduces day–night temperature differences.

* `Seasonal Variability:`

  * Temperatures rise in summer due to increased solar radiation and fall in winter.
  * Latitude, altitude, and local climate influence seasonal patterns.

* `Weather Influences:`

  * Wind enhances mixing, reducing temperature differences.
  * Humidity affects heat retention.
  * Passing fronts cause abrupt temperature changes.

The atmosphere responds quickly to heat changes, making its temperature patterns more dynamic than soil or water.

#### Temperature Variability in the Lithosphere (Soil Layer){.text-center}

* **Surface soil exhibits the highest variability.**

  * It heats rapidly during the day and cools rapidly at night.
* **Diurnal wave:**

  * Temperature changes propagate downward but diminish with depth.
  * At around 1–2 meters, daily temperature variation becomes minimal.
* **Seasonal wave:**

  * Temperature variations at deeper layers (up to several meters) follow seasonal cycles.
  * Peak soil temperature lags behind peak air temperature by several weeks.
* **Factors influencing soil temperature variability**:

  * Soil color (dark soils absorb more heat)
  * Texture (sandy soils heat faster than clay)
  * Moisture (wet soils heat slowly but store heat longer)
  * Organic matter (insulating effect)
  * Vegetation or mulch (shading reduces fluctuations)

#### Temperature Variability in the Hydrosphere{.text-center}

* Water bodies show the `least variability`.
* **Diurnal changes** are ++small++ due to `high heat capacity`.
* **Seasonal variation** is more visible, especially in lakes and shallow seas, but still less than in soil or air.
* Vertical water mixing distributes heat, reducing temperature gradients.
* `Groundwater` temperature remains almost `constant` throughout the year—often close to mean annual air temperature.
* Waterlogged soils have a thermal environment more similar to water than dry soil.
