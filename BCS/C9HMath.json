For this reason, sets have been discussed in the Mathematics books of class VIII and IX. In this chapter, we go beyond the materials covered there.\n\nAfter completing the chapter, students will be able to:\n- Form universal sets, subsets, complements of a set, and power sets;\n- Form union, intersection, and difference of sets;\n- Prove the properties of set operations;\n- Describe equivalent sets and explain the concept of infinite sets;\n- Explain the formula for determining the union set, power set, and verify with the help of Venn diagrams and examples;\n- Solve real-life problems using set operations and formulas;\n- Explain the concept of relations and functions by using sets;\n- Determine the domain and range of functions;\n- Explain one-one function, onto function, one-one and onto functions with examples;\n- Explain inverse functions;\n- Verify whether a relation is a function or not with the help of graphs;\n- Draw graphs of relations and functions.</md></sn>","topic_id":949,"last_visited":"2025-04-26T10:37:05.096Z"},{"topic_name":"01.Set Basic","topic_html":"<sn><md class=\"p-1 p-md-2 my-2\" data-rr=\"true\" data-formula=\"true\">### **Set Basic**\n---\n**Set** : Collection of well-defined Objects.\n\n**Example**\n\\[\nS = \\{1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100\\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nHere `S` denotes the set of square of integers which are less than 10.\n\nThe Process of expressing set in this method is called **Tabluar Method**\n\n---\n\nEach of the Objects forming a set are called **elements** of that set.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Set} = \\{  \\text{element},\\text{element},\\text{element} \\}\n\\]\n\n---\n\nIf x is an element of a set A then we write \n\\[\nx \\in A \n\\]\n\nIf x is not an element of a set A then we write\n\n\\[\nx \\notin A\n\\]\n\n---\n\nThe aforementioned set `S` was \\( \\text{S} = \\{ 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100 \\}\\) ,and the method is **Tabular**.\n\nNow\n\\[\n\\text{S} = \\{ \\text{x:x is square number not greater than 100} \\}\n\\]\n\nThis method is called **Set Builder Method**\n\n\n</md></sn>","topic_id":950,"last_visited":"2025-04-26T11:22:52.048Z"}],"chapter_id":247}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2025-04-26T10:13:26.554Z","is_private":false,"folder":"BCS","web_url":"https://qdoc.free.nf","last_update_on":"2025-04-26T11:22:54.196Z"}
