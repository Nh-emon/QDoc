The tense here is present simple, as *am* is in the *V1* form.\n\n#### **Evaluating Verb Type, Form, and Sentence Tense**\n\n- **He **is** a good man.**\n  - Here, **is** is the main verb since there is no other verb. **Is** is in the *V5* (s/es) form, so the sentence is in the present simple tense.\n\n- **He *is* **learning** English.**\n  - In this sentence, there are two verbs: *is* (helping verb) and **learning** (main verb).\n  - *Is* is in the *V5* form, and **learning** is in the *V4* form.

Since **ball** comes immediately after the verb **kicked** without any intervening preposition, **ball** is the object of the verb **kicked**.\n\nüëâ To confirm, we question the verb by **what** or **whom**:\n- He kicked **what**? (Answer: The ball)\n- He kicked **whom**? (Answer: The ball)\n\nThus, **the ball**:\n- Is a **noun** (based on part of speech)\n- Functions as an **object**\n- Serves as the **verb object** for the verb **kicked**.</md></sn><sn><md class=\"p-1 p-md-2 my-2\" data-rr=\"true\">#### **Example Analysis**\n\n---\n\n##### **The baby was crying**\n- **Baby** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.\n- **Was** is the helping verb; **crying** is the main verb.\n- No noun or pronoun follows the verb, so there is **no object** for the verb **crying**.\n\n---\n\n##### **She came on time**\n- **She** is a pronoun.\n- **Came** is the main verb in *V2* form.\n- **On** is a preposition.\n- **Time** is a noun acting as an object.\n  - Since **time** follows the preposition **on**, it is the **object of the preposition on**.\n\n---\n\n##### **I am going to London**\n- **I** is a pronoun.\n- **Am** is the helping verb; **going** is the main verb in *V4* (-ing) form.\n- **To** is a preposition.\n- **London** is a noun following the preposition **to**, making it the **object of the preposition to**.\n\n---\n\n##### **Rahul speaks loudly**\n- **Rahul** is a noun.\n- **Speaks** is the main verb in *V5* (-s/es) form.\n- **Loudly** is an adverb.\n  - Since adverbs are neither nouns nor pronouns, **loudly** is **not an object**.\n\n---\n\n##### **I saw a sick man** (üëâ Important)\n- **I** is a pronoun functioning as the subject.\n- **Saw** is the main verb in *V2* form.\n- **A sick man**:\n  - **Man** is the noun, preceded by the adjective **sick** and the article **a**.\n  - Despite the article and adjective, **man** is directly linked to the verb **saw**, making it the **object of the verb saw**.\n\nüëâ Further clarification:\n- I saw **what**? (Answer: Man)\n- I saw **whom**? (Answer: Man)\n\nThus, **man** is the **verb object**.\n\n---\n\n##### **The supporters ran away from the meeting**\n- **Supporters** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**, acting as the subject.\n- **Ran** is the main verb in *V2* form.\n- **From** is a preposition.\n- **Meeting** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.\n  - Since **meeting** follows the preposition **from**, it is the **object of the preposition from**.\n  - **Meeting** is **not** the object of the verb **ran**.\n\n---\n\n##### **The prices of car have fallen sharply**\n- **Prices** is a noun, preceded by the article **the**.\n- **Car** is a noun following the preposition **of**.\n- **Have** is a helping verb; **fallen** is the main verb in *V3* form.\n- **Sharply** is an adverb modifying the verb **fallen**.\n  - Since **sharply** is not a noun or pronoun, it is **not an object**.\n\n---\n\n#### **She killed him**\n- `She` is  pronoun\n- `killed` is the main verb in v2 form\n- `him` is a pronoun and it come right after the verb `killed` and there is no preposition between them so `him` is the object of verb `killed`</md></sn>","topic_id":971,"last_visited":"2025-04-27T14:25:53.049Z"}],"chapter_id":250}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2025-04-27T02:30:14.088Z","is_private":false,"folder":"BCS","web_url":"https://qdoc.free.nf","nameKeys":["chapter_name","topic_name"],"last_update_on":"2025-04-27T14:25:55.602Z"}
