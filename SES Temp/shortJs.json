It provides a framework for predicting and analyzing random events, making it essential in fields such as statistics, finance, engineering, science, and everyday decision-making.<br><br>###### **1. Basic Concepts**<br><br>- **Experiment**: A procedure or action that results in one or several possible outcomes. For example, tossing a coin or rolling a die.<br>  <br>- **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. <br>  - *Example*: For a coin toss, the sample space is \\( S = \\{ \\text{Heads}, \\text{Tails} \\} \\).<br><br>- **Event**: A subset of the sample space. It can consist of one outcome or multiple outcomes.<br>  - *Example*: Getting a \"Head\" when tossing a coin is an event.<br><br>### **2. Calculating Probability**<br><br>The probability of an event quantifies how likely it is to occur, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).<br><br>- **Theoretical Probability**:<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}<br>  \\]<br>  <br>  *Example*: Probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die:<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(3) = \\frac{1}{6}<br>  \\]<br><br>- **Experimental (Empirical) Probability**:<br>  <br>  Based on actual experiments or historical data.<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times event E occurred}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}<br>  \\]<br>  <br>  *Example*: If you flip a coin 100 times and get 55 heads, the experimental probability of getting heads is \\( \\frac{55}{100} = 0.55 \\).<br><br>### **3. Probability Rules**<br><br>- **Complementary Rule**:<br>  <br>  The probability of an event not occurring is \\( 1 - P(E) \\).<br>  <br>  *Example*: If \\( P(E) = 0.3 \\), then \\( P(\\text{not } E) = 0.7 \\).<br><br>- **Addition Rule**:<br>  <br>  For two mutually exclusive events (events that cannot occur simultaneously):<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)<br>  \\]<br>  <br>  If events are not mutually exclusive:<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B)<br>  \\]<br>  <br>- **Multiplication Rule**:<br>  <br>  For independent events (the outcome of one does not affect the other):<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)<br>  \\]<br>  <br>  For dependent events:<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B | A)<br>  \\]<br>  <br>  where \\( P(B | A) \\) is the probability of B given A has occurred.<br><br>### **4. Types of Probability**<br><br>- **Discrete Probability**:<br>  <br>  Deals with finite or countable outcomes.<br>  <br>  *Example*: Number of heads in coin tosses.<br><br>- **Continuous Probability**:<br>  <br>  Involves outcomes that form a continuum, often associated with measurements.<br>  <br>  *Example*: The exact height of individuals in a population.<br><br>### **5. Probability Distributions**<br><br>- **Discrete Probability Distribution**:<br>  <br>  Assigns probabilities to each outcome in a discrete sample space.<br>  <br>  *Example*: Probability distribution of rolling a die.<br><br>- **Continuous Probability Distribution**:<br>  <br>  Uses probability density functions (PDFs) to describe the likelihood of outcomes within a range.<br>  <br>  *Example*: Normal distribution, which describes many natural phenomena like heights or test scores.<br><br>### **6. Applications of Probability**<br><br>- **Statistics**: Estimating population parameters and testing hypotheses.<br>  <br>- **Finance**: Assessing risks and returns in investment portfolios.<br>  <br>- **Engineering**: Reliability testing and quality control.<br>  <br>- **Science**: Modeling natural phenomena and conducting experiments.<br>  <br>- **Everyday Life**: Making decisions under uncertainty, such as weather forecasting or game strategies.<br><br>### **7. Key Probability Concepts**<br><br>- **Random Variable**: A variable that takes on different values based on the outcome of a random event.<br>  <br>- **Expected Value (Mean)**: The long-term average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents.<br>  <br>  \\[<br>  E(X) = \\sum [x \\times P(x)]<br>  \\]<br>  <br>- **Variance and Standard Deviation**: Measure the spread or dispersion of a set of values.<br><br>### **Example Problem**<br><br>**Problem**: What is the probability of drawing an Ace from a standard deck of 52 playing cards?<br><br>**Solution**:<br>- Number of favorable outcomes (Aces) = 4<br>- Total number of possible outcomes (cards) = 52<br><br>\\[<br>P(\\text{Ace}) = \\frac{4}{52} = \\frac{1}{13} \\approx 0.0769 \\text{ or } 7.69\\%<br>\\]<br><br>### **Conclusion**<br><br>Probability provides a systematic way to assess and quantify uncertainty. By understanding its foundational principles and rules, you can analyze a wide range of random phenomena, make informed predictions, and make decisions based on likelihoods and risks.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":219,"last_visited":"2024-10-12T13:00:19.318Z"}],"chapter_id":97}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-11T16:06:41.363Z","is_private":false,"folder":"SES Temp","web_url":"https://localhost","last_update_on":"2024-10-12T13:08:06.358Z"}
