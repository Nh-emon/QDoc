<sn><md>Project Publisment:

[meet up] :
1.contact nannu pranto and redwan for metting
2.choosing silence enviroment
3.basics talk

[problem] :
1.how we read a topic
  from teacher sheet (outdated and here and there,not enough,hard to find later on phone,desktop)
  chatgpt : short response and unrelated topic
  wikipedia : long response and unwanted topic
  book : require multiple book and not arranged like our syllabus
  other note : they will not share their physical note
  
2.  
so when we study 50% time consumed by collecting the resources
It take almost 3 to 4 hours to complete a topic
I want to resolve this issue and creating a online book based on our topic

[resolving problem] :
I want after creating a note for 3 to 4 hours.i dont want to seek next topic ,i will share my note and you will share my note

A system where a person create a on a special topic from multiple resources like sheet,book,chatgpt,wikipedia,youtube,website and will connect to others note,multiple people simultaneously work on a sujbect,chapter,topic and research based approach to handle study

So I create a topic for 3 hours and i dont have to look for the second one the group member already created that note for me,if i convince then i took his note it will reduce our time to research


Now the question is how we will do it?
Qn.by phone,by fb,wp how we share note
Qn.WHo will update the note
Qn.Who is the owner
Qn.How we can get note from others


[introducing QDOc] :
Introducing the applicaton that meet this requirement QDOC

I work on for 1.5 years on this project

Every author has an account,group based they create one topic,this application join all thier topic in a particular subject where they all the author is owner of that

[answering future question] :
Qn.hand written note is better than online note
-&gt;Who tell you to it replace the hand written note instead it is created to save the hand written note to share with others,we are with hand written note,creating note on paper is our fast approeach 


Qn.We dont know ms word,powerpoint how we will create this note,
-&gt;where ms word take 30 minutes to create a note you need only 3 minustes to create a note,if it was harder than will note recommneded you.

QN.i dont have enough time to work on project,i quit?
-&gt; here is the interesting part,if one or two member or author quit or rest,the project will remain grow,other author note dynamically appended to your note


[arrangin people] :
