<sn><md>## Personal Projects

As life unfolds with complexity and uncertainty, we all search for purpose, direction, and balance. Projects are not merely tasks or careers but **fields of meaning**—paths where we wish to grow, contribute, and evolve. The following is a personal project structure that reflects such life-driven intent, informed by deep curiosity, spiritual pursuit, career goals, and self-development.

Each of these projects may change shape over time as  understanding matures and circumstances shift. The architecture you've created—Output, Credits, Resources, Estimate Period, Checkpoints, Routing, and Priority—can serve as a guiding compass across all of them.
