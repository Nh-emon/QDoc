The process involves:<br><br>1. **Infiltration**: Precipitation (rain or snow) infiltrates the ground, filling the pore spaces in soil and rock formations, recharging groundwater.<br>2. **Percolation**: Water continues to move downward through the soil and rock layers until it reaches the **water table**, the upper boundary of the groundwater.<br>3. **Storage**: Groundwater accumulates in aquifersâ€”underground reservoirs where it can be stored for long periods.<br>4. **Discharge**: Groundwater eventually discharges into rivers, lakes, and oceans through springs and base flow, or it can be extracted by wells for human use.<br>5. **Evaporation/Transpiration**: Some groundwater re-emerges at the surface and contributes to evaporation or is absorbed by plants, which then release water back into the atmosphere via transpiration.<br><br>### Occurrence of Groundwater<br><br>Groundwater occurs in two primary zones:<br><br>1. **Unsaturated Zone (Vadose Zone)**: <br>   - Located just below the surface.<br>   - Contains both air and water in the pores.<br>   - Water here is not considered groundwater until it percolates deeper.<br><br>2. **Saturated Zone (Phreatic Zone)**:<br>   - All pore spaces are completely filled with water.<br>   - The upper boundary of this zone is the **water table**.<br>   - This is where groundwater is stored in **aquifers**, which can be classified as:<br>     - **Unconfined aquifers**: Open to surface water, allowing for easy recharge.<br>     - **Confined aquifers**: Sandwiched between impermeable layers of rock, trapping water under pressure.<br><br>Groundwater may also surface naturally through **springs** or contribute to stream flow, playing a key part in maintaining rivers during dry periods.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":292,"last_visited":"2024-10-23T03:54:35.511Z"}],"chapter_id":119}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-23T02:39:25.649Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-10-23T04:18:34.628Z"}
