Petrology is essential in understanding the Earth's crust and the processes that form and transform rocks over time</p></sn><sn><h5>Petrogenesis<br></h5><p>The study of the origin of rocks, known as <strong>petrogenesis</strong>, involves investigating how different rocks are formed. This includes understanding the source materials (magma, sediments, or pre-existing rocks), the conditions under which they form (pressure, temperature, and chemical environment), and the geological processes that lead to their transformation over time. Petrogenesis helps scientists trace the history and evolution of the Earthâ€™s crust.</p></sn>","topic_id":289,"last_visited":"2024-10-22T05:11:23.365Z"},{"topic_name":"03.Composition and Classification of Igneous Rock","topic_html":"<sn><h5>Igneous Rock<br></h5><pg>https://drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1665236926_Igneous_Rock_Drishti_IAS_English.jpeg</pg><h5>#Wiki<br></h5><pg>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock</pg></sn>","topic_id":290,"last_visited":"2024-10-22T05:12:33.131Z"}],"chapter_id":118}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-13T10:58:22.065Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-10-22T05:27:41.195Z"}
