Understanding the structure of matter is crucial for predicting its physical and chemical properties, reactivity, and behavior in different environments.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Atoms and Atomic Structure**<br><br>Atoms, the building blocks of matter, are made up of three primary particles:<br><br>1. **Protons**: Positively charged particles located in the nucleus of an atom.<br>2. **Neutrons**: Neutral particles also located in the nucleus.<br>3. **Electrons**: Negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus in energy levels or shells.<br><br>The structure of an atom, particularly the arrangement of its electrons, plays a critical role in how it interacts with other atoms.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Electron Configuration and Shells**<br>Electrons are arranged in energy levels (shells) around the nucleus of an atom. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, determines how an atom bonds with other atoms.<br><br>- **Octet Rule**: Atoms tend to bond in such a way that they have eight electrons in their valence shell, achieving a stable configuration similar to noble gases.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Types of Chemical Bonds**<br><br>1. **Ionic Bonds**:<br>   - Formed when one atom transfers electrons to another atom, resulting in positively and negatively charged ions.<br>   - **Example**: Sodium chloride (NaCl), where sodium donates an electron to chlorine.<br><br>2. **Covalent Bonds**:<br>   - Formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.<br>   - Can be **single**, **double**, or **triple** bonds depending on the number of shared electron pairs.<br>   - **Example**: Water (H₂O), where oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms.<br><br>3. **Metallic Bonds**:<br>   - In metals, electrons are delocalized and move freely among the atoms, forming a \"sea of electrons.\"<br>   - This bond gives metals their characteristic properties, such as conductivity and malleability.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Molecular Structure and Geometry**<br><br>The spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule determines its geometry, which directly influences the molecule's properties and reactivity.<br><br>- **Linear**: Atoms are arranged in a straight line (e.g., carbon dioxide, CO₂).<br>- **Trigonal Planar**: Atoms form a triangular shape (e.g., boron trifluoride, BF₃).<br>- **Tetrahedral**: Four atoms are symmetrically arranged around a central atom (e.g., methane, CH₄).<br>- **Bent/Angular**: The molecule has a bent shape due to lone pairs of electrons (e.g., water, H₂O).<br><br>---<br><br>### **Polarity and Intermolecular Forces**<br><br>1. **Polarity**: A molecule is polar if it has a positive and negative end due to unequal sharing of electrons.<br>   - **Example**: Water (H₂O) is polar because oxygen pulls the shared electrons more strongly than hydrogen.<br><br>2. **Intermolecular Forces**:<br>   - **Hydrogen Bonding**: A strong interaction between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen) and another electronegative atom.<br>   - **Van der Waals Forces**: Weak attractions between molecules due to temporary dipoles.<br>   - **Dipole-Dipole Interactions**: Occur between polar molecules.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Crystalline and Amorphous Structures**<br><br>1. **Crystalline Solids**: Atoms or molecules are arranged in a highly ordered, repeating pattern.<br>   - **Example**: Sodium chloride (table salt), quartz.<br><br>2. **Amorphous Solids**: Atoms or molecules do not have a long-range order.<br>   - **Example**: Glass, rubber.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Significance of Chemical Structure**<br>The chemical structure of a substance determines its properties, including:<br>- **Solubility**: Whether it dissolves in water or other solvents.<br>- **Reactivity**: How it behaves in chemical reactions.<br>- **Boiling and Melting Points**: Stronger bonds often result in higher boiling and melting points.<br><br>---<br><br>Understanding the chemical structure of matter is key to predicting how different substances will interact and how their properties can be altered for various applications, such as in materials science, biology, and industrial chemistry.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":222,"last_visited":"2024-10-13T04:04:06.359Z"},{"topic_name":"Duel Nature of Matter","topic_html":"<sn><h5>Dual Nature of Matter<br></h5><im>https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/chemistry/2017/03/02111857/Particles-Waves.png Dual Behavior of Electromagnetic Radiation</im></sn><sn><md data-rr=\"true\" data-formula=\"true\"><pre class=\"selectedEl\">##### Dual Nature of Matter<br><br>The concept of the dual nature of matter refers to the idea that matter exhibits both `particle-like` and `wave-like` properties. This principle is fundamental in quantum mechanics and helps explain the behavior of very small particles, such as electrons and photons.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Historical Background**<br><br>1. **Particle Nature of Matter**<br>   - Traditionally, matter was considered to have only particle-like properties. This understanding dates back to classical physics, where matter was viewed as composed of discrete particles with mass and occupying space.<br><br>2. **Wave Nature of Light**<br>   - In contrast, light was historically thought to behave like a wave. The wave nature of light was demonstrated through phenomena such as interference and diffraction.<br><br>However, discoveries in the early 20th century led to a more nuanced view, particularly with the rise of quantum mechanics.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Wave-Particle Duality**<br><br>1. **Louis de Broglie’s Hypothesis (1924)**:<br>   - De Broglie proposed that particles, such as electrons, could also exhibit wave-like behavior.<br>   - He introduced the concept of **matter waves**, suggesting that every particle has a wavelength associated with it, given by the de Broglie equation:<br>   <br>   \\[<br>   \\lambda = \\frac{h}{mv}<br>   \\]<br>   - Where:<br>     - \\( \\lambda \\) is the wavelength of the particle,<br>     - \\( h \\) is Planck’s constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ Js),<br>     - \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle,<br>     - \\( v \\) is the velocity of the particle.<br><br>2. **Experimental Evidence**:<br>   - **Davisson-Germer Experiment (1927)**: Demonstrated the wave nature of electrons through electron diffraction, providing empirical evidence for de Broglie’s hypothesis.<br>   - **Electron Microscopes**: The wave nature of electrons allows electron microscopes to achieve much higher resolutions than optical microscopes, as electron wavelengths are much shorter than visible light.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Wave-Like and Particle-Like Properties**<br><br>1. **Wave-Like Properties**:<br>   - **Interference**: Matter waves can interfere with each other, producing constructive or destructive interference patterns, just like light waves.<br>   - **Diffraction**: Matter waves can bend around obstacles or spread out when passing through narrow openings.<br><br>2. **Particle-Like Properties**:<br>   - **Mass and Momentum**: Particles have mass and can be localized in space.<br>   - **Discrete Energy Levels**: In quantum systems (e.g., atoms), particles like electrons occupy specific energy levels, exhibiting behavior characteristic of particles.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Applications of Dual Nature of Matter**<br><br>1. **Quantum Mechanics**:<br>   - The dual nature of matter is a core concept in quantum mechanics, explaining behaviors at the atomic and subatomic levels.<br>   <br>2. **Electron Behavior in Atoms**:<br>   - Electrons, although often considered particles, occupy orbitals around the nucleus that are described by wave functions, predicting the probability of an electron's location rather than its exact position.<br><br>3. **Modern Technology**:<br>   - **Electron Microscopy**: Utilizes the wave properties of electrons to visualize structures at the atomic level.<br>   - **Quantum Computing**: Explores the quantum behavior of particles, leveraging the principles of wave-particle duality to perform complex computations.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Summary**<br><br>The dual nature of matter bridges the gap between classical and quantum physics, revealing that particles, especially at the microscopic level, can behave like waves under certain conditions. This concept is fundamental to understanding the behavior of electrons, photons, and other subatomic particles, and it has led to numerous technological advancements in science and engineering.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":223,"last_visited":"2024-10-13T04:17:15.525Z"},{"topic_name":"Nature and Composition of matter","topic_html":"<sn><md data-rr=\"true\"><pre>##### Topic 2: The Nature and Composition of Matter<br><br>Matter, the fundamental substance that makes up the universe, exists in various forms and structures.

It sought to address some limitations of Bohr's model, particularly in explaining the fine structure of spectral lines and providing a more accurate description of electron orbits. Here's an overview of the **Bohr-Sommerfeld model**:<br><br>---<br><br>### **Key Features of the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model**<br>1. **Quantized Electron Orbits (Extended)**:<br>   - Like Bohr’s model, electrons revolve around the nucleus in discrete orbits or energy levels.<br>   - However, **Sommerfeld** introduced the concept that electron orbits could be **elliptical** (not just circular) in addition to circular orbits.<br><br>2. **Additional Quantum Numbers**:<br>   - **Principal Quantum Number (\\(n\\))**: Denotes the main energy level of an electron, just like in Bohr’s model.<br>   - **Azimuthal Quantum Number (\\(l\\))**: Describes the shape of the electron's orbit (circular or elliptical) and is related to the angular momentum of the electron.<br>   - **Magnetic Quantum Number (\\(m\\))**: Describes the orientation of the orbit in space.<br><br>3. **Quantization of Angular Momentum**:<br>   - The angular momentum of an electron is still quantized, but in this model, Sommerfeld extended Bohr’s rule. The angular momentum is now quantized as:<br>     \\[<br>     L = n h / 2\\pi \\quad \\text{(for circular orbits)}<br>     \\]<br>     and for elliptical orbits, the **azimuthal quantum number** (\\(l\\)) comes into play.<br><br>4. **Fine Structure**:<br>   - The Bohr-Sommerfeld model successfully explained the **fine structure** of spectral lines, which refers to small splitting of spectral lines due to relativistic effects and electron spin.<br>   - It incorporated **relativity** (special theory of relativity) into the analysis of electron motion, accounting for small corrections to energy levels, particularly in the hydrogen atom's spectrum.<br><br>5. **Electron Spin**:<br>   - The model also laid the groundwork for understanding **electron spin** (though it did not fully develop the concept). Electron spin, which is a quantum mechanical property, was later incorporated into quantum theory after the Bohr-Sommerfeld model.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Strengths of the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model**<br>1. **Improved Explanation of Spectral Lines**:<br>   - It explained the fine structure of hydrogen’s spectral lines and some other multi-electron atoms more effectively than Bohr’s model.<br>   <br>2. **Elliptical Orbits**:<br>   - By allowing elliptical orbits, it provided a better understanding of the behavior of electrons in atoms beyond hydrogen.<br><br>3. **Incorporation of Relativity**:<br>   - Sommerfeld introduced corrections to Bohr's model by considering the relativistic effects on the orbits of fast-moving electrons.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Limitations of the Bohr-Sommerfeld Model**<br>1. **Not Fully Quantum Mechanical**:<br>   - The model still relied on classical ideas (such as orbits) and did not fully embrace the principles of quantum mechanics that would later be developed.<br>   <br>2. **Failed for Multi-Electron Atoms**:<br>   - While it worked reasonably well for hydrogen and hydrogen-like ions, the Bohr-Sommerfeld model could not adequately explain the spectra of atoms with more than one electron.<br><br>3. **Electron Orbit Concept**:<br>   - The model still treated electrons as particles moving in orbits, which was later replaced by the more accurate quantum mechanical model (Schrödinger's wave equation and the concept of orbitals).<br><br>---<br><br>### **Significance**<br>The **Bohr-Sommerfeld model** was a crucial step in the development of quantum mechanics.

It is expressed in units of electron volts (eV) or kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol).  <br><br>\\[<br>\\text{X (g)} + \\text{Ionization Energy} \\rightarrow \\text{X}^+ (g) + e^-<br>\\]<br><br>- **First Ionization Potential (IE₁)**: Energy required to remove the first electron.  <br>- **Second Ionization Potential (IE₂)**: Energy required to remove the second electron after the first has been removed, and so on.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Trends of Ionization Potential in the Periodic Table**<br><br>#### 1. **Across a Period (Left to Right):**<br>- **Trend**: **Ionization potential increases** as you move across a period.<br>- **Reason**:<br>  - Atomic radius decreases, so electrons are closer to the nucleus.<br>  - Nuclear charge (number of protons) increases, strengthening the pull on electrons.<br>  - Shielding effect remains relatively constant as electrons are added to the same energy level.<br>- **Example**:<br>  - In Period 2:  <br>    Li (520 kJ/mol) &lt;

These trends are governed by factors such as atomic structure, effective nuclear charge, shielding effect, and electron configuration.<br><br>### 1. **Atomic Size (Atomic Radius)**<br><br>- **Across a Period** (left to right):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Decreases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move across a period, the number of protons increases, leading to a stronger effective nuclear charge. This pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus, reducing the size of the atom.<br>  <br>- **Down a Group** (top to bottom):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Increases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move down a group, new electron shells are added, which increases the distance between the outermost electrons and the nucleus. Although the nuclear charge increases, the effect is counteracted by the shielding effect of inner electrons, resulting in a larger atomic radius.<br><br>### 2. **Ionization Energy (IE)**<br><br>- **Across a Period** (left to right):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Increases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move across a period, the atomic size decreases and the effective nuclear charge increases, making it harder to remove an electron. Therefore, more energy is required to remove the outermost electron.<br>  <br>- **Down a Group** (top to bottom):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Decreases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move down a group, the atomic size increases, and the outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus. This reduces the effective nuclear attraction on the outermost electrons, making it easier to remove them, thus requiring less ionization energy.<br><br>### 3. **Electronegativity (EN)**<br><br>- **Across a Period** (left to right):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Increases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move across a period, the atomic size decreases and the effective nuclear charge increases, leading to a stronger attraction for shared electrons in a bond. This results in higher electronegativity values.<br>  <br>- **Down a Group** (top to bottom):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Decreases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move down a group, the atomic size increases, and the outermost electrons are farther from the nucleus. This reduces the effective nuclear attraction for bonding electrons, leading to a decrease in electronegativity.<br><br>### 4. **Melting Point**<br><br>- **Across a Period** (left to right):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Increases** (up to the middle of the period) and then **decreases**.  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move across the period, the metallic elements on the left generally have high melting points due to the strong metallic bonds. In the middle of the period, elements like carbon (diamond) and silicon have very high melting points due to strong covalent bonds. However, non-metals on the right (like noble gases) have low melting points due to weak intermolecular forces.<br>  <br>- **Down a Group** (top to bottom):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Varies**.  <br>  - **Reason**: The melting points of elements can vary significantly down a group. In some groups (e.g., alkali metals), the melting point decreases as the atomic size increases. In other groups (e.g., transition metals), the melting points can remain high or even increase due to strong metallic bonds.<br><br>### 5. **Electron Affinity (EA)**<br><br>- **Across a Period** (left to right):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Increases** (becomes more negative).  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move across a period, the atomic size decreases, and the effective nuclear charge increases, making it easier to add an electron to an atom. Therefore, electron affinity generally becomes more negative across a period, indicating that atoms release more energy when they gain an electron.<br>  <br>- **Down a Group** (top to bottom):  <br>  - **Trend**: **Decreases** (becomes less negative).  <br>  - **Reason**: As you move down a group, the atomic size increases, and the added electron is farther from the nucleus. The increased shielding effect reduces the nucleus' ability to attract the incoming electron, leading to a decrease in electron affinity.<br><br>### Summary of Trends:<br><br>| Property             | Across a Period (left to right) | Down a Group (top to bottom) |<br>|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|<br>| **Atomic Size**       | Decreases                       | Increases                   |<br>| **Ionization Energy (IE)** | Increases                       | Decreases                   |<br>| **Electronegativity (EN)** | Increases                       | Decreases                   |<br>| **Melting Point**     | Increases (then decreases)      | Varies                     |<br>| **Electron Affinity (EA)** | Becomes more negative (increases) | Becomes less negative (decreases) |<br><br>### Key Notes:<br>- **Ionization energy** and **electronegativity** are often directly correlated, both increasing across a period and decreasing down a group.<br>- **Atomic size** is inversely related to **ionization energy** and **electronegativity**: as the atomic radius increases, it becomes easier to remove electrons, and the atom's attraction for electrons decreases.<br>- **Melting point** trends are more complex and depend on the type of bonding (metallic, covalent, or molecular) present in the element or compound.<br>- **Electron affinity** is generally more negative across a period due to increasing nuclear charge, but decreases down a group as the atomic size increases.<br><br>These periodic trends provide a systematic way to predict and understand the chemical behavior of elements based on their position in the periodic table.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":486,"last_visited":"2024-11-16T03:26:01.442Z"},{"topic_name":"06.Diagonal relationship","topic_html":"<sn><im>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/DiagonalRelation.png</im></sn><sn><h3>Diagonal relationship</h3><nt>Some element in period 2,3 show similar physical and chemcial properties despite of different group and period with their diagonal positioned element due to similar size,charge,Ip,En</nt><h5>Example :</h5><p>Li-Mg : Both are light metal+their compound(oxide,hydroxide) are basic in nature,they form similar compound such as halide and show similarities in their reactions with water and acids</p><p>Be-Al : Both are amphoteric+their compound show amphoteric properties</p><p>B-Si : Both form covalent compound,beign non-metal with relatively hight melting point,their oxides are acidic in nature</p><p>The <strong>diagonal relationship</strong> in the periodic table highlights the periodic trends that show how elements positioned diagonally to each other in the table often share similar properties.

Precipitation reactions are commonly seen in ionic compounds dissolved in water, where certain combinations of ions lead to insoluble products.<br><br>### Key Concepts in Precipitation Reactions<br><br>1. **Insolubility**: Precipitation occurs when two soluble compounds in solution react to form an insoluble compound.

Conversely, for endothermic processes, heating enhances the product yield.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":500,"last_visited":"2024-11-17T00:39:18.510Z"}],"chapter_id":111},{"chapter_name":"08.Chemical Kinetics","topics":[{"topic_name":"01.Zero first and second order reaction","topic_html":"<div class=\"col-12 col-md-11 col-lg-9 my-2 mx-auto p-2 border content-section rounded-2\" data-el=\"section\"><h5 data-el=\"title\">Order of Reaction<br></h5><p class=\"light-note p-3 rounded-1 mx-2 mb-2 text-light box-bg\">The order of a reaction is defined as the sum of the powers of concentrations in the rate law</p><p data-el=\"text\">The order of below reaction is&nbsp; order = (m+n)<br></p><div class=\"math-box p-3 border rounded-2 box-bg my-2\"><math title=\"rate = k [A]^m [B]^n\"><mstyle><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>k</mi><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow><mi>m</mi></msup><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup></mstyle></math></div><p></p><p data-el=\"text\">The order of a reaction can also be defined with respect to a single reactant.

between reaction rates and the factors influencing them, such as temperature and molecular interactions. Below is a structured outline of these theories:<br><br>---<br><br>### **1. Arrhenius Theory**<br>The Arrhenius theory provides a mathematical relationship between the rate constant (\\(k\\)) of a reaction and temperature (\\(T\\)).<br><br>#### **Key Concepts:**<br>- **Arrhenius Equation:**<br>  \\[<br>  k = A e^{-\\frac{E_a}{RT}}<br>  \\]<br>  where:<br>  - \\(k\\) = rate constant<br>  - \\(A\\) = frequency factor (pre-exponential factor)<br>  - \\(E_a\\) = activation energy (energy barrier for the reaction)<br>  - \\(R\\) = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)<br>  - \\(T\\) = absolute temperature (K)<br>  <br>- **Activation Energy (\\(E_a\\)):**<br>  - Minimum energy required for reactants to transform into products.<br>  - A higher \\(E_a\\) leads to a slower reaction, while a lower \\(E_a\\) speeds it up.<br><br>- **Temperature Dependence:**<br>  - Increasing \\(T\\) increases \\(k\\), exponentially enhancing the reaction rate.<br><br>- **Arrhenius Plot:**<br>  - A linear plot of \\(\\ln(k)\\) vs. \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\) yields a slope of \\(-\\frac{E_a}{R}\\) and an intercept of \\(\\ln(A)\\).<br><br>#### **Implications:**<br>- Provides insight into the kinetic parameters (\\(E_a\\) and \\(A\\)) for a reaction.<br>- Explains why reaction rates increase with temperature.<br><br>---<br><br>### **2. Collision Theory**<br>Collision theory explains how molecular interactions lead to chemical reactions.<br><br>#### **Key Concepts:**<br>- **Collision Requirements:**<br>  For a reaction to occur, collisions between molecules must:<br>  1. Have sufficient energy (\\(\\geq E_a\\)).<br>  2. Occur with the correct orientation.<br><br>- **Effective Collisions:**<br>  Only a fraction of collisions, known as effective collisions, lead to a reaction.<br><br>- **Rate Equation in Collision Theory:**<br>  \\[<br>  k = Z \\cdot P \\cdot e^{-\\frac{E_a}{RT}}<br>  \\]<br>  where:<br>  - \\(Z\\) = collision frequency (number of collisions per unit time)<br>  - \\(P\\) = steric factor (fraction of collisions with correct orientation)<br>  - \\(e^{-\\frac{E_a}{RT}}\\) = fraction of collisions with sufficient energy<br><br>- **Temperature Influence:**<br>  - Higher temperatures increase molecular speed, raising collision frequency (\\(Z\\)) and energy, leading to more effective collisions.<br><br>- **Steric Factor (\\(P\\)):**<br>  - Reflects the geometric and orientation constraints of reactants.<br><br>#### **Implications:**<br>- Explains how physical and molecular factors affect reaction rates.<br>- Provides a molecular-level understanding of the Arrhenius equation.<br><br>---<br><br>### **Comparison of Arrhenius and Collision Theories:**<br>| **Aspect**                  | **Arrhenius Theory**                                     | **Collision Theory**                                   |<br>|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|<br>| **Focus**                   | Empirical temperature dependence of rate constant       | Molecular basis of reaction rates                    |<br>| **Equation Basis**          | Arrhenius equation                                      | Modified rate equation (includes molecular collisions) |<br>| **Parameters**              | \\(E_a\\), \\(A\\)                                          | \\(Z\\), \\(P\\), \\(E_a\\)                                |<br>| **Energy and Orientation**  | Focuses on \\(E_a\\)                                      | Includes \\(E_a\\) and orientation effects             |<br><br>--- <br><br>### **Integration of Theories:**<br>Collision theory offers a molecular explanation for the terms in the Arrhenius equation:<br>- \\(A\\) is linked to \\(Z \\cdot P\\), the product of collision frequency and steric factor.<br>- Both theories emphasize the importance of activation energy and temperature in determining reaction rates. <br><br>This combination bridges macroscopic and microscopic understandings of chemical kinetics.</pre></md></sn><sn><h5>Arhenius More</h5><ul><li>It has been found that generally an increase of temperature increases the rate of reaction</li><li> As a rule, an increase of temperature by 10°C doubles the reaction rate.&nbsp; We know that the kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature</li><li> Thus as the temperature of a system is increased, more and more molecules will acquire necessary energy greater that Ea to cause productive collisions</li><li> This increases the rate of the reaction</li><li> In 1889, Arrhenius suggested as simple relationship between the rate constant, k, for a reaction and the temperature of the system</li></ul></sn><sn><h5>collision theory</h5><p>According to this theory, a chemical reaction takes place only by collisions between the reacting\nmolecules</p><p>The two main conditions for a collision between the reacting molecules to be productive are</p><ul><li>1.The colliding molecules must posses sufficient kinetic energy to cause a reaction</li><li>2. The reacting molecules must collide with proper orientation.</li></ul><p>From the above discussion it is clear that : Only the molecules colliding with kinetic energy\ngreater that Ea and with correct orientation can cause reaction.</p><nt>Note : Insert Note Here</nt></sn>","topic_id":267,"last_visited":"2024-12-01T13:36:56.190Z"}],"chapter_id":110}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-13T02:50:00.697Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-12-01T13:36:59.239Z"}
