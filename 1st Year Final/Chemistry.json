It plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us, from the molecular level to large-scale industrial processes. Chemistry bridges other sciences like physics, biology, and environmental science, providing insights into both natural phenomena and human-made materials.<br><br>The scope of chemistry is vast and includes:<br><br>1. **Inorganic Chemistry**: The study of minerals, metals, and other non-organic compounds.<br>2. **Organic Chemistry**: Focuses on carbon-containing compounds and their reactions, which are crucial in fields like pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals.<br>3. **Physical Chemistry**: Deals with the physical properties of molecules and the principles that govern chemical reactions, blending chemistry with physics.<br>4. **Analytical Chemistry**: Involves techniques and methods used to analyze substances, detecting their composition and quantity.<br>5. **Biochemistry**: Studies the chemical processes within living organisms, essential for understanding biological functions and processes.<br>6. **Environmental Chemistry**: Focuses on the chemical aspects of the environment, including pollution and sustainable practices.<br><br>This broad scope makes chemistry fundamental in fields like medicine, agriculture, energy production, and materials science.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":220,"last_visited":"2024-10-13T02:53:56.427Z"}],"chapter_id":98}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-13T02:50:00.697Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-10-13T03:22:43.799Z"}
