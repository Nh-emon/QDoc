Each group plays a crucial role in soil health, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning.<br><br>---<br><br>#### Macro-organisms<br><br>Macro-organisms are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. They include:<br><br>1. **Invertebrates**<br>   - **Earthworms**: Improve soil structure and fertility through burrowing and organic matter processing.<br>   - **Insects**: Includes ants, beetles, and termites, which contribute to decomposition and nutrient cycling.<br>   - **Arachnids**: Such as spiders and mites, which help control pest populations.<br><br>2. **Vertebrates**<br>   - **Mammals**: Moles, rodents, and larger animals that burrow and mix soil.<br>   - **Birds**: Help in seed dispersal and soil aeration through their foraging activities.<br><br>3. **Plants**<br>   - **Roots of various plants**: Contribute to soil stability, nutrient uptake, and organic matter through root decay.<br><br>---<br><br>#### Microorganisms<br><br>Microorganisms are too small to be seen without a microscope. They include:<br><br>1. **Bacteria**<br>   - Decomposers that break down organic matter, recycle nutrients, and play a key role in nitrogen fixation.<br><br>2. **Fungi**<br>   - Includes mycorrhizal fungi that form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, aiding in nutrient absorption and soil structure.<br><br>3. **Protozoa**<br>   - Single-celled organisms that feed on bacteria and organic matter, playing a role in nutrient cycling.<br><br>4. **Algae**<br>   - Photosynthetic microorganisms that contribute to organic matter and soil structure, especially in moist environments.<br><br>5. **Viruses**<br>   - Often interact with other microorganisms and can influence microbial community dynamics.<br><br>---<br><br>Each of these organisms contributes to the soil ecosystem, impacting soil health, fertility, and sustainability.

Their contributions can be categorized into several key areas:<br><br>---<br><br>#### 1. Nutrient Cycling<br><br>- **Decomposition**: Macro-organisms like earthworms and microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi break down organic matter (e.g., dead plants and animals) into simpler compounds, releasing essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) that plants can absorb.<br>- **Nutrient Fixation**: Certain bacteria, like nitrogen-fixing species (e.g., Rhizobium), convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form usable by plants, enriching the soil with this critical nutrient.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 2. Soil Structure and Stability<br><br>- **Soil Aeration**: Macro-organisms like earthworms create channels in the soil as they burrow, improving aeration and drainage, which are crucial for root health.<br>- **Aggregation**: Fungi produce substances that help bind soil particles together, forming aggregates that enhance soil structure, water retention, and root penetration.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 3. Disease Suppression<br><br>- **Biological Control**: Certain soil microorganisms can suppress soil-borne pathogens by competing for resources, producing antimicrobial compounds, or triggering plant defense mechanisms.<br>- **Healthy Microbial Communities**: A diverse microbial community can prevent the dominance of harmful pathogens, leading to healthier plants.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 4. Water Retention<br><br>- **Organic Matter Formation**: Soil organisms contribute to the formation of humus, which improves soil's ability to retain water and maintain moisture levels critical for plant growth.<br>- **Soil Moisture Regulation**: The activities of macro-organisms also help regulate soil moisture levels, ensuring plants have access to adequate water.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 5. Symbiotic Relationships<br><br>- **Mycorrhizal Associations**: Fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, enhancing nutrient and water uptake in exchange for carbohydrates produced by plants.<br>- **Root Nodules**: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria form nodules on the roots of legumes, providing plants with a steady supply of nitrogen.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 6. Plant Growth Promotion<br><br>- **Growth-Promoting Substances**: Some soil microorganisms produce plant hormones (e.g., auxins) that stimulate plant growth and root development.<br>- **Enhanced Seed Germination**: Certain beneficial microorganisms can improve seed germination rates by enhancing nutrient availability.<br><br>---<br><br>In summary, soil organisms are essential for nutrient cycling, soil structure, disease suppression, water retention, and promoting plant growth. Their diverse interactions contribute to a healthy and productive soil ecosystem, which is fundamental for sustainable agriculture and ecosystem health.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":228,"last_visited":"2024-10-14T03:57:48.457Z"},{"topic_name":"Sources of H and OH in soil","topic_html":"<sn class=\"current-slide\"><h3>Sources of H+ and OH- in Soil</h3><im>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nh-emon/QDoc/main/media/sources%20of%20h%20in%20soil.png Sources of H+ in soil</im><im>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nh-emon/QDoc/main/media/sources%20of%20oh%20in%20soil.png Sources of OH- in soil</im></sn><sn><md data-rr=\"true\"><pre>#### Sources of H⁺ and OH⁻ in Soil<br><br>The presence of hydrogen ions (H⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in soil plays a crucial role in soil chemistry, affecting pH, nutrient availability, and overall soil health.

In the 18th century, European scientists began formal studies, leading to the first soil classification systems. Justus von Liebig’s 19th-century work on plant nutrition introduced the concept of soil as a nutrient source, transforming agriculture. Vasily Dokuchaev, a Russian scientist, is often considered the father of modern Soil Science; in the late 1800s, he developed the idea that soil is a natural body shaped by environmental factors. By the early 20th century, the field expanded globally, with significant contributions from American and European researchers. Soil Science then diversified into sub-disciplines, focusing on physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. The mid-20th century brought advancements in soil conservation, responding to erosion and degradation issues. In recent decades, Soil Science has integrated technology, like remote sensing and GIS, enhancing soil mapping and analysis. Today, it is central to sustainable development, food security, and climate change mitigation efforts.</p></sn>","topic_id":302,"last_visited":"2024-10-27T10:10:45.524Z"}],"chapter_id":120}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-14T01:38:41.565Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-10-27T10:18:43.102Z"}
