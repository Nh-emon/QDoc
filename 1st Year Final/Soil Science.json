In the 18th century, European scientists began formal studies, leading to the first soil classification systems. Justus von Liebig’s 19th-century work on plant nutrition introduced the concept of soil as a nutrient source, transforming agriculture. Vasily Dokuchaev, a Russian scientist, is often considered the father of modern Soil Science; in the late 1800s, he developed the idea that soil is a natural body shaped by environmental factors. By the early 20th century, the field expanded globally, with significant contributions from American and European researchers. Soil Science then diversified into sub-disciplines, focusing on physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. The mid-20th century brought advancements in soil conservation, responding to erosion and degradation issues. In recent decades, Soil Science has integrated technology, like remote sensing and GIS, enhancing soil mapping and analysis. Today, it is central to sustainable development, food security, and climate change mitigation efforts.</p></sn>","topic_id":302,"last_visited":"2024-10-27T10:10:45.524Z"},{"topic_name":"03.Relation of soil science With other branches of science","topic_html":"<sn><h5>Relation of soil science With other branches of science (r:chatgpt)</h5><md data-rr=\"true\"><pre>Soil Science is deeply interconnected with numerous other scientific fields, each contributing to a comprehensive understanding of soil and its functions.

Cooler climates slow down these processes.<br>   - **Precipitation**: Abundant rainfall enhances chemical weathering and leaching, leading to nutrient depletion in the upper layers and the formation of distinct horizons.<br>   - **Seasonal Variability**: Freeze-thaw cycles in temperate regions cause physical weathering, while dry seasons in tropical regions influence soil moisture levels.<br><br>---<br><br>#### 2. **Organisms (Biota)**<br><br>   - **Plants**: Roots physically break down rocks and secrete organic acids that chemically weather minerals. Decomposing plant material contributes to organic matter and humus in the soil.<br>   - **Microorganisms**: Bacteria, fungi, and other microbes decompose organic material, releasing nutrients and forming humus.
