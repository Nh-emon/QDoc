Relations can be represented as sets of pairs, tables, or graphs. For example, in the relation \\((x, y)\\), \\(x\\) is called the **domain** (input), and \\(y\\) is called the **range** (output).<br><br>**Example:**<br>- Let \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{4, 5, 6\\}\\).<br>- A relation from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) could be \\(\\{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)\\}\\).<br><br>##### Functions<br><br>A **function** is a special type of relation where each element in the domain (input) is related to exactly one element in the range (output). This means that no two pairs can have the same first element with different second elements.<br><br>**Example:**<br>- Let \\(f: A \\to B\\), where \\(f(x) = x^2\\).<br>- If \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(f(A) = \\{(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)\\}\\).<br><br>##### Key Differences<br>- **Relation**: Can have multiple outputs for a single input.<br>- **Function**: Each input has exactly one output.<br><br>##### Function Representation:<br>1. **Mapping notation**: \\( f: A \\to B \\)<br>2. **Rule notation**: \\( f(x) = x^2 \\)<br>3. **Graphical representation**: A curve or line showing the input-output relationship.</pre></md></sn>","topic_id":237,"last_visited":"2024-10-15T01:47:42.547Z"}],"chapter_id":107}],"author":{"login":"Nh-emon","id":146737722,"node_id":"U_kgDOCL8KOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146737722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon","html_url":"https://github.com/Nh-emon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nh-emon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false,"name":"Emon","company":null,"blog":"","location":null,"email":null,"hireable":null,"bio":null,"twitter_username":null,"public_repos":20,"public_gists":0,"followers":1,"following":1,"created_at":"2023-10-02T13:07:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T16:33:13Z"},"created_on":"2024-10-15T01:45:45.128Z","is_private":false,"folder":"1st Year Final","web_url":"https://qdock.free.nf","last_update_on":"2024-10-15T02:00:47.932Z"}
