Relations can be represented as sets of pairs, tables, or graphs. For example, in the relation \\((x, y)\\), \\(x\\) is called the **domain** (input), and \\(y\\) is called the **range** (output).<br><br>**Example:**<br>- Let \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\) and \\(B = \\{4, 5, 6\\}\\).<br>- A relation from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) could be \\(\\{(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)\\}\\).<br><br>##### Functions<br><br>A **function** is a special type of relation where each element in the domain (input) is related to exactly one element in the range (output). This means that no two pairs can have the same first element with different second elements.<br><br>**Example:**<br>- Let \\(f: A \\to B\\), where \\(f(x) = x^2\\).<br>- If \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\), then \\(f(A) = \\{(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)\\}\\).<br><br>##### Key Differences<br>- **Relation**: Can have multiple outputs for a single input.<br>- **Function**: Each input has exactly one output.<br><br>##### Function Representation:<br>1. **Mapping notation**: \\( f: A \\to B \\)<br>2. **Rule notation**: \\( f(x) = x^2 \\)<br>3. **Graphical representation**: A curve or line showing the input-output relationship.</pre></md></sn><sn><h5>Relation vs Function</h5><md data-rr=\"true\" data-formula=\"true\"><pre>Here’s a comparison table of **relation** vs **function** with examples:<br><br>| **Aspect**           | **Relation**                                       | **Function**                                      |<br>|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|<br>| **Definition**        | A set of ordered pairs where each input may map to one or more outputs. | A special relation where each input maps to exactly one output. |<br>| **Input-Output Rule** | An input can have multiple outputs.               | Each input has exactly one output.               |<br>| **Graphical Representation** | Can show multiple points for a single input on a graph. | No vertical line intersects the graph more than once. |<br>| **Example Set**       | \\( \\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)\\} \\)                  | \\( \\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)\\} \\)                |<br>| **Example Explanation** | In this relation, input 1 is related to both 2 and 3, which is allowed in a relation. | In this function, each input has a unique output, as required for functions. |<br>| **Representation**    | \\((x, y)\\), where multiple values of \\(y\\) are allowed for one \\(x\\). | \\((x, y)\\), where each \\(x\\) has only one \\(y\\). |<br><br>### Examples<br><br>#### Relation Example<br>- **Set**: \\(\\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)\\}\\)<br>- **Explanation**: Input 1 is paired with both 2 and 3.

These conditions ensure that every input has only one output.<br><br>---<br>1. **Unique Output for Each Input**: <br>   - For every value in the domain (input), there must be exactly one corresponding value in the range (output). In other words, no input can have more than one output.<br><br>2. **Defined for All Domain Values**: <br>   - The function must be defined for every value in its domain. This means that there should not be any gaps, such as undefined operations (e.g., division by zero).<br>   <br>3. **Input-Output Pairing**: <br>   - Each element in the domain must have a corresponding output in the range.<br><br>##### Example 1: Valid Function<br>Let \\( f(x) = x^2 \\).<br><br>- **Domain**: All real numbers \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\).<br>- **Range**: All non-negative real numbers \\( [0, \\infty) \\).<br><br>In this case, each input (e.g., \\( f(2) = 4 \\) and \\( f(-2) = 4 \\)) has only one output, so this is a valid function.<br><br>##### Example 2: Invalid Function<br>Let \\( R = \\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)\\} \\).<br><br>In this relation, the input \\(1\\) has two different outputs: 2 and 3. This violates the condition of a function that each input can have only one output.

The x-axis typically represents the input values (\\(x\\)), and the y-axis represents the corresponding output values (\\(f(x)\\)).<br><br>#### Key Characteristics of a Function's Graph<br><br>---<br><br>1. **Vertical Line Test**:  <br>   A graph is considered a function if and only if **no vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point**.  <br>   - If a vertical line crosses the graph more than once, it means a single input has multiple outputs, which violates the function rule.<br><br>---<br><br>2. **Continuity and Smoothness**:  <br>   Functions can be continuous (no breaks) or have discontinuities (gaps or jumps). For example, polynomial functions are smooth and continuous, while piecewise functions can have breaks.<br><br>---<br><br>3. **Symmetry**:  <br>   Some functions have symmetry (e.g., even functions are symmetric about the y-axis, and odd functions are symmetric about the origin).<br><br>---<br><br>#### Example Graph: Quadratic Function<br><br>For a quadratic function like \\( f(x) = x^2 \\), the graph is a parabola opening upwards, with its vertex at (0, 0).<br><br>- **Domain**: All real numbers \\( (-\\infty, \\infty) \\).<br>- **Range**: All non-negative real numbers \\( [0, \\infty) \\).<br><br>If you’d like, I can generate a sample graph for a function to illustrate this visually.
