<sn><md>## Project: Al Quran Study

This project is designed to  understand, memorize, and reflect on the Al Quran in a multi-lingual and spiritually transformative way. The goal is not only personal growth and character development but also preparing for future Islamic dawah work.In my college time I just read the Al Quran verses in Bengali,It is Ahmed Dedat who inspired me to memorizing Al Quran Verse in Arabic and giving translation line by line.So I decided to learn Al Quran with English,Bangla and in Arabic.
